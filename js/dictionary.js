{i:3,k:"Abjects",t:"(<r>Ps. 35:15</r>), the translation of a Hebrew word meaning smiters; probably, in allusion to the tongue, slanderers. (<r>Comp. Jer. 18:18.</r>)"},
{i:4,k:"Ablution",t:"or washing, was practised, (1.) When a person was initiated into a higher state: e.g., when Aaron and his sons were set apart to the priest's office, they were washed with water previous to their investiture with the priestly robes (<r>Lev. 8:6</r>)."},
{i:5,k:"Abner",t:"father of light; i.e., 'enlightening', the son of Ner and uncle of Saul. He was commander-in-chief of Saul's army (<r>1 Sam. 14:50; 17:55; 20:25</r>). He first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over Goliath (<r>1 Sam. 17:57</r>). After the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king (<r>2 Sam. 2:8</r>). A state of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth's army, was fought with David's army under Joab at Gibeon (<r>2 Sam. 2:12</r>). Abner, escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was 'light of foot as a wild roe,' the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his spear (<r>2 Sam. 2: 18-32</r>)."},
{i:6,k:"Abomination",t:"This word is used, (1.) To express the idea that the Egyptians considered themselves as defiled when they ate with strangers (<r>Gen. 43:32</r>). The Jews subsequently followed the same practice, holding it unlawful to eat or drink with foreigners (<r>John 18:28; Acts 10:28; 11:3</r>)."},
{i:7,k:"Abraham",t:"father of a multitude, son of Terah, named (<r>Gen. 11:27</r>) before his older brothers Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir of the promises. Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God (<r>Acts 7:2-4</r>). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in Gen. 12. While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God (<r>Gen. 12:1,2</r>); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, 'not knowing whither he went' (<r>Heb. 11:8</r>). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him."},
{i:8,k:"Abraham's bosom",t:"(<r>Luke 16:22,23</r>) refers to the custom of reclining on couches at table, which was prevalent among the Jews, an arrangement which brought the head of one person almost into the bosom of the one who sat or reclined above him. To 'be in Abraham's bosom' thus meant to enjoy happiness and rest (<r>Matt. 8:11; Luke 16:23</r>) at the banquet in Paradise. (See BANQUET; MEALS"},

{i:11,k:"Absalom",t:"father of peace; i.e., 'peaceful' David's son by Maacah (<r>2 Sam. 3:3; comp. 1 Kings 1:6</r>). He was noted for his personal beauty and for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his head (<r>2 Sam. 14:25,26</r>). The first public act of his life was the blood-revenge he executed against Amnon, David's eldest son, who had basely wronged Absalom's sister Tamar. This revenge was executed at the time of the festivities connected with a great sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David's other sons fled from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years (<r>2 Sam. 3:3; 13:23-38</r>)."},
{i:12,k:"Acacia",t:"(Heb. shittim) Ex. 25:5, R.V. probably the Acacia seyal (the gum-arabic tree); called the 'shittah' tree (<r>Isa. 41:19</r>). Its wood is called shittim wood (<r>Ex. 26:15,26; 25:10,13,23,28, etc.</r>). This species (A. seyal) is like the hawthorn, a gnarled and thorny tree. It yields the gum-arabic of commerce. It is found in abundance in the Sinaitic peninsula."},
{i:13,k:"Accad",t:"the high land or mountains, a city in the land of Shinar. It has been identified with the mounds of Akker Kuf, some 50 miles to the north of Babylon; but this is doubtful. It was one of the cities of Nimrod's kingdom (<r>Ge 10:10</r>). It stood close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara. (<see target='x-self'>See SEPHARVAIM.</see>)"},
{i:14,k:"Accho",t:"sultry or sandy, a town and harbour of Phoenicia, in the tribe of Asher, but never acquired by them (<r>Judg. 1:31</r>). It was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans by the name of Ptolemais, from Ptolemy the king of Egypt, who rebuilt it about B.C. 100. Here Paul landed on his last journey to Jerusalem (<r>Acts 21:7</r>). During the crusades of the Middle Ages it was called Acra; and subsequently, on account of its being occupied by the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem, it was called St. Jean d'Acre, or simply Acre."},
{i:15,k:"Accuser",t:"Satan is styled the 'accuser of the brethren' (<r>Rev. 12:10. Comp. Job 1:6; Zech. 3:1</r>), as seeking to uphold his influence among men by bringing false charges against Christians, with the view of weakening their influence and injuring the cause with which they are identified. He was regarded by the Jews as the accuser of men before God, laying to their charge the violations of the law of which they were guilty, and demanding their punishment. The same Greek word, rendered 'accuser,' is found in John 8:10 (but omitted in the Revised Version); Acts 23:30, 35; 24:8; 25:16, 18, in all of which places it is used of one who brings a charge against another."},
{i:16,k:"Aceldama",t:"the name which the Jews gave in their proper tongue, i.e., in Aramaic, to the field which was purchased with the money which had been given to the betrayer of our Lord. The word means 'field of blood.' It was previously called 'the potter's field' (<r>Matt. 27:7, 8; Acts 1:19</r>), and was appropriated as the burial-place for strangers. It lies on a narrow level terrace on the south face of the valley of Hinnom. Its modern name is Hak ed-damm."},
{i:17,k:"Achaia",t:"the name originally of a narrow strip of territory in Greece, on the north-west of the Peloponnesus. Subsequently it was applied by the Romans to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea, and the south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces (Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the country when it fell under their dominion. It is in this latter enlarged meaning that the name is always used in the New Testament (<r>Acts 18:12, 27; 19:21; Rom. 15: 26; 16:5, etc.</r>). It was at the time when Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles under the proconsular form of government; hence the appropriate title given to Gallio as the 'deputy,' i.e., proconsul, of Achaia (<r>Acts 18:12</r>)."},
{i:18,k:"Achaichus",t:"(<r>1 Cor. 16:17</r>), one of the members of the church of Corinth who, with Fortunatus and Stephanas, visited Paul while he was at Ephesus, for the purpose of consulting him on the affairs of the church. These three probably were the bearers of the letter from Corinth to the apostle to which he alludes in 1 Cor. 7:1."},
{i:19,k:"Achan",t:"called also Achar, i.e., one who troubles (<r>1 Chr. 2:7</r>), in commemoration of his crime, which brought upon him an awful destruction (<r>Josh. 7:1</r>). On the occasion of the fall of Jericho, he seized, contrary to the divine command, an ingot of gold, a quantity of silver, and a costly Babylonish garment, which he hid in his tent. Joshua was convinced that the defeat which the Israelites afterwards sustained before Ai was a proof of the divine displeasure on account of some crime, and he at once adopted means by the use of the lot for discovering the criminal. It was then found that Achan was guilty, and he was stoned to death in the valley of Achor. He and all that belonged to him were then consumed by fire, and a heap of stones was raised over the ashes."},
{i:20,k:"Achbor",t:"gnawing = mouse. (1.) An Edomitish king (<r>Gen. 36:38; 1 Chr. 1:49</r>)."},
{i:21,k:"Achish",t:"angry, perhaps only a general title of royalty applicable to the Philistine kings. (1.) The king with whom David sought refuge when he fled from Saul (<r>1 Sam. 21:10-15</r>). He is called Abimelech in the superscription of Ps. 34. It was probably this same king to whom David a second time repaired at the head of a band of 600 warriors, and who assigned him Ziklag, whence he carried on war against the surrounding tribes (<r>1 Sam. 27:5-12</r>). Achish had great confidence in the valour and fidelity of David (<r>1 Sam. 28:1,2</r>), but at the instigation of his courtiers did not permit him to go up to battle along with the Philistine hosts (<r>1 Sam. 29:2-11</r>). David remained with Achish a year and four months. (2.) Another king of Gath, probably grandson of the foregoing, to whom the two servants of Shimei fled. This led Shimei to go to Gath in pursuit of them, and the consequence was that Solomon put him to death (<r>1 Kings 2:39-46</r>)."},
{i:22,k:"Achmetha",t:"(<r>Ezra 6:2</r>), called Ecbatana by classical writers, the capital of northern Media. Here was the palace which was the residence of the old Median monarchs, and of Cyrus and Cambyses. In the time of Ezra, the Persian kings resided usually at Susa of Babylon. But Cyrus held his court at Achmetha; and Ezra, writing a century after, correctly mentions the place where the decree of Cyrus was found."},
{i:23,k:"Achor",t:"trouble, a valley near Jericho, so called in consequence of the trouble which the sin of Achan caused Israel (<r>Josh. 7:24,26</r>). The expression 'valley of Achor' probably became proverbial for that which caused trouble, and when Isaiah (<r>Isa. 65:10</r>) refers to it he uses it in this sense: 'The valley of Achor, a place for herds to lie down in;' i.e., that which had been a source of calamity would become a source of blessing. Hosea also (<r>Hos. 2:15</r>) uses the expression in the same sense: 'The valley of Achor for a door of hope;' i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady Kelt."},
{i:24,k:"Achsah",t:"anklet, Caleb's only daughter (<r>1 Chr. 2:49</r>). She was offered in marriage to the man who would lead an attack on the city of Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This was done by Othniel (q.v.), who accordingly obtained her as his wife (<r>Josh. 15:16-19; Judg. 1:9-15</r>)."},
{i:25,k:"Achshaph",t:"fascination, a royal city of the Canaanites, in the north of Palestine (<r>Josh. 11:1; 12:20; 19:25</r>). It was in the eastern boundary of the tribe of Asher, and is identified with the modern ruined village of Kesaf or Yasif, N.E. of Accho."},
{i:26,k:"Achzib",t:"falsehood. (1.) A town in the Shephelah, or plain country of Judah (<r>Josh. 15:44</r>); probably the same as Chezib of Gen. 38:5 = Ain Kezbeh."},
{i:27,k:"Acre",t:"is the translation of a word (tse'med), which properly means a yoke, and denotes a space of ground that may be ploughed by a yoke of oxen in a day. It is about an acre of our measure (<r>Isa. 5:10; 1 Sam. 14:14</r>)."},
{i:28,k:"Acts of the Apostles",t:"the title now given to the fifth and last of the historical books of the New Testament. The author styles it a 'treatise' (1:1). It was early called 'The Acts,' 'The Gospel of the Holy Ghost,' and 'The Gospel of the Resurrection.' It contains properly no account of any of the apostles except Peter and Paul. John is noticed only three times; and all that is recorded of James, the son of Zebedee, is his execution by Herod. It is properly therefore not the history of the 'Acts of the Apostles,' a title which was given to the book at a later date, but of 'Acts of Apostles,' or more correctly, of 'Some Acts of Certain Apostles.'"},
{i:29,k:"Adah",t:"ornament. (1.) The first of Lamech's two wives, and the mother of Jabal and Jubal (<r>Gen. 4:19, 20, 23</r>)."},
{i:30,k:"Adam",t:"red, a Babylonian word, the generic name for man, having the same meaning in the Hebrew and the Assyrian languages. It was the name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book of Moses (<r>Gen. 1:27-ch. 5</r>). 'God created man [Heb., Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.'"},
{i:31,k:"Adam, a type",t:"The apostle Paul speaks of Adam as 'the figure of him who was to come.' On this account our Lord is sometimes called the second Adam. This typical relation is described in Rom. 5:14-19."},
{i:32,k:"Adam, the city of",t:"is referred to in Josh. 3:16. It stood 'beside Zarethan,' on the west bank of Jordan (<r>1 Kings 4:12</r>). At this city the flow of the water was arrested and rose up 'upon an heap' at the time of the Israelites' passing over (<r>Josh. 3:16</r>)."},
{i:33,k:"Adamah",t:"red earth, a fortified city of Naphtali, probably the modern Damieh, on the west side of the sea of Tiberias (<r>Josh. 19:33, 36</r>)."},
{i:34,k:"Adamant",t:"(Heb. shamir), Ezek. 3:9. The Greek word adamas means diamond. This stone is not referred to, but corundum or some kind of hard steel. It is an emblem of firmness in resisting adversaries of the truth (<r>Zech. 7:12</r>), and of hard-heartedness against the truth (<r>Jer. 17:1</r>)."},
{i:35,k:"Adar",t:"large, the sixth month of the civil and the twelfth of the ecclesiastical year of the Jews (<r>Esther 3:7, 13; 8:12; 9:1, 15, 17, 19, 21</r>). It included the days extending from the new moon of our March to the new moon of April. The name was first used after the Captivity. When the season was backward, and the lambs not yet of a paschal size, or the barley not forward enough for abib, then a month called Veadar, i.e., a second Adar, was intercalated."},

{i:38,k:"Adder",t:"(<r>Ps. 140:3; Rom. 3:13, 'asp'</r>) is the rendering of, (1.) Akshub ('coiling' or 'lying in wait'), properly an asp or viper, found only in this passage. (2.) Pethen ('twisting'), a viper or venomous serpent identified with the cobra (Naja haje) (<r>Ps. 58:4; 91:13</r>); elsewhere 'asp.' (3.) Tziphoni ('hissing') (<r>Prov. 23:32</r>); elsewhere rendered 'cockatrice,' Isa. 11:8; 14:29; 59:5; Jer. 8:17, as it is here in the margin of the Authorized Version. The Revised Version has 'basilisk.' This may have been the yellow viper, the Daboia xanthina, the largest and most dangerous of the vipers of Palestine. (4.) Shephiphon ('creeping'), occurring only in Gen. 49:17, the small speckled venomous snake, the 'horned snake,' or cerastes. Dan is compared to this serpent, which springs from its hiding-place on the passer-by."},

{i:48,k:"Adoni-zedec",t:"lord of justice or righteousness, was king in Jerusalem at the time when the Israelites invaded Palestine (<r>Josh. 10:1,3</r>). He formed a confederacy with the other Canaanitish kings against the Israelites, but was utterly routed by Joshua when he was engaged in besieging the Gibeonites. The history of this victory and of the treatment of the five confederated kings is recorded in Josh. 10:1-27. (<r>Comp. Deut. 21:23</r>). Among the Tell Amarna tablets (<see target='x-self'>see EGYPT</see>) are some very interesting letters from Adoni-zedec to the King of Egypt. These illustrate in a very remarkable manner the history recorded in Josh. 10, and indeed throw light on the wars of conquest generally, so that they may be read as a kind of commentary on the book of Joshua. Here the conquering career of the Abiri (i.e., Hebrews) is graphically described: 'Behold, I say that the land of the king my lord is ruined', 'The wars are mighty against me', 'The Hebrew chiefs plunder all the king's lands', 'Behold, I the chief of the Amorites am breaking to pieces.' Then he implores the king of Egypt to send soldiers to help him, directing that the army should come by sea to Ascalon or Gaza, and thence march to Wru-sa-lim (Jerusalem) by the valley of Elah."},
{i:49,k:"Adonibezek",t:"lord of Bezek, a Canaanitish king who, having subdued seventy of the chiefs that were around him, made an attack against the armies of Judah and Simeon, but was defeated and brought as a captive to Jerusalem, where his thumbs and great toes were cut off.

But Solomon, a younger brother, was preferred to him. Adonijah, however, when his father was dying, caused himself to be proclaimed king. But Nathan and Bathsheba induced David to give orders that Solomon should at once be proclaimed and admitted to the throne. Adonijah fled and took refuge at the altar, and received pardon for his conduct from Solomon on the condition that he showed himself 'a worthy man' (<r>1 Kings 1:5-53</r>).

{i:55,k:"Aaron",t:"the eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi (<r>Ex. 6:20</r>). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam (2:1,4; 7:7). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah (6:23; 1 Chr. 2:10), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God (<r>Ex. 4:14,27-30</r>) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the 'mouth' or 'prophet' of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance (7:1,2,9,10,19).

Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. 'And in process of time' (marg. 'at the end of days', i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. 'The Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect' (<r>Gen. 4:3-5</r>). On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect (<r>Gen. 4:8,9. Comp. 1 John 3:12</r>). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as 'righteous' (<r>Matt. 23:35</r>). 'The blood of sprinkling' is said to speak 'better things than that of Abel' (<r>Heb. 12:24</r>); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said (<r>Heb. 11:4</r>) that 'Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.' This sacrifice was made 'by faith;' this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that 'faith' which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel's offering was accepted of God. Cain's offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die."},

When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam (<r>1 Sam. 22:20-23; 23:6</r>). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (<r>1 Sam. 30:7</r>). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest (<r>1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26</r>) and the 'king's companion' (<r>1 Chr. 27:34</r>). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (<r>1 Kings 4:4</r>). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (<r>1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27</r>). Zadok now became sole high priest. In Mark 2:26, reference is made to an occurrence in 'the days of Abiathar the high priest.' But from 1 Sam. 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time (<r>Lev. 24:9</r>) a priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his father to give them."},

As a mark of respect he gave to Abraham valuable gifts, and offered him a settlement in any part of his country; while at the same time he delicately and yet severely rebuked him for having practised a deception upon him in pretending that Sarah was only his sister. Among the gifts presented by the king were a thousand pieces of silver as a 'covering of the eyes' for Sarah; i.e., either as an atoning gift and a testimony of her innocence in the sight of all, or rather for the purpose of procuring a veil for Sarah to conceal her beauty, and thus as a reproof to her for not having worn a veil which, as a married woman, she ought to have done.

His wife was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil influence over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive, he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war (<r>1 Kings 22:3</r>) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow from a bow 'drawn at a venture' pierced him, and though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah's prophecy (<r>1 Kings 21:19</r>) was fulfilled. He reigned twenty-three years. Because of his idolatry, lust, and covetousness, Ahab is referred to as pre-eminently the type of a wicked king (<r>2 Kings 8:18; 2 Chr. 22:3; Micah 6:16</r>)."},

He united with Jehoshaphat in an attempt to revive maritime trade by the Red Sea, which proved a failure (<r>2 Chr. 20:35-37</r>). His messengers, sent to consult the god of Ekron regarding his recovery from the effects of a fall from the roof-gallery of his palace, were met on the way by Elijah, who sent them back to tell the king that he would never rise from his bed (<r>1 Kings 22:51; 2 Kings 1:18</r>)."},

He was the twelfth high priest, and officiated at Nob, where he was visited by David (to whom and his companions he gave five loaves of the showbread) when he fled from Saul (<r>1 Sam. 21:1-9</r>). He was summoned into Saul's presence, and accused, on the information of Doeg the Edomite, of disloyalty because of his kindness to David; whereupon the king commanded that he, with the other priests who stood beside him (86 in all), should be put to death. This sentence was carried into execution by Doeg in the most cruel manner (<r>1 Sam. 22:9-23</r>).

David sent his old friend Hushai back to Absalom, in order that he might counteract the counsel of Ahithophel (<r>2 Sam. 15:31-37</r>). This end was so far gained that Ahithophel saw he had no longer any influence, and accordingly he at once left the camp of Absalom and returned to Giloh, his native place, where, after arranging his wordly affairs, he hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers (<r>2 Sam. 17:1-23</r>).

These boxes were made from a stone found near Alabastron in Egypt, and from this circumstance the Greeks gave them the name of the city where they were made. The name was then given to the stone of which they were made; and finally to all perfume vessels, of whatever material they were formed. The woman 'broke' the vessel; i.e., she broke off, as was usually done, the long and narrow neck so as to reach the contents. This stone resembles marble, but is softer in its texture, and hence very easily wrought into boxes. Mark says (14:5) that this box of ointment was worth more than 300 pence, i.e., denarii, each of the value of sevenpence halfpenny of our money, and therefore worth about 10 pounds. But if we take the denarius as the day's wage of a labourer (<r>Matt. 20:2</r>), say two shillings of our money, then the whole would be worth about 30 pounds, so costly was Mary's offering."},

Apollos, eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures, was a native of this city (<r>Acts 18:24</r>). Many Jews from Alexandria were in Jerusalem, where they had a synagogue (<r>Acts 6:9</r>), at the time of Stephen's martyrdom. At one time it is said that as many as 10,000 Jews resided in this city. It possessed a famous library of 700,000 volumes, which was burned by the Saracens (A.D. 642). It was here that the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek. This is called the Septuagint version, from the tradition that seventy learned men were engaged in executing it. It was, however, not all translated at one time.

{i:180,k:"Almond",t:"a native of Syria and Palestine. In form, blossoms, and fruit it resembles the peach tree. Its blossoms are of a very pale pink colour, and appear before its leaves. Its Hebrew name, _shaked_, signifying 'wakeful, hastening,' is given to it on account of its putting forth its blossoms so early, generally in February, and sometimes even in January. In Eccl. 12:5, it is referred to as illustrative, probably, of the haste with which old age comes. There are others, however, who still contend for the old interpretation here. 'The almond tree bears its blossoms in the midst of winter, on a naked, leafless stem, and these blossoms (reddish or flesh-coloured in the beginning) seem at the time of their fall exactly like white snow-flakes. In this way the almond blossom is a very fitting symbol of old age, with its silvery hair and its wintry, dry, barren, unfruitful condition.' In Jer. 1:11 'I see a rod of an almond tree [shaked]...for I will hasten [shaked] my word to perform it' the word is used as an emblem of promptitude. Jacob desired his sons (<r>Gen. 43:11</r>) to take with them into Egypt of the best fruits of the land, almonds, etc., as a present to Joseph, probably because this tree was not a native of Egypt. Aaron's rod yielded almonds (<r>Num. 17:8; Heb. 9:4</r>). Moses was directed to make certain parts of the candlestick for the ark of carved work 'like unto almonds' (<r>Ex. 25:33, 34</r>). The Hebrew word _luz_, translated 'hazel' in the Authorized Version (<r>Gen. 30:37</r>), is rendered in the Revised Version 'almond.'

Some suppose it to have been the white sandal-wood of India, the Santalum album of botanists, a native of the mountainous parts of the Malabar coasts. It is a fragrant wood, and is used in China for incense in idol-worship.

It is found in China, Siam, and Northern India, and grows to the height sometimes of 120 feet. This species is of great rarity even in India. There is another and more common species, called by Indians aghil, whence Europeans have given it the name of Lignum aquile, or eagle-wood.

{i:192,k:"Amasa",t:"burden. (1.) The son of Abigail, a sister of king David (<r>1 Chr. 2:17; 2 Sam. 17:25</r>).

{i:197,k:"Ambassador",t:"In the Old Testament the Hebrew word _tsir_, meaning 'one who goes on an errand,' is rendered thus (<r>Josh. 9:4; Prov. 13:17; Isa. 18:2; Jer. 49:14; Obad. 1:1</r>). This is also the rendering of _melits_, meaning 'an interpreter,' in 2 Chr. 32:31; and of _malak_, a 'messenger,' in 2 Chr. 35:21; Isa. 30:4; 33:7; Ezek. 17:15.

{i:198,k:"Amber",t:"(<r>Ezek. 1:4, 27; 8:2. Heb., hashmal, rendered by the LXX. elektron, and by the Vulgate electrum</r>), a metal compounded of silver and gold. Some translate the word by 'polished brass,' others 'fine brass,' as in Rev. 1:15; 2:18. It was probably the mixture now called electrum. The word has no connection, however, with what is now called amber, which is a gummy substance, reckoned as belonging to the mineral kingdom though of vegetable origin, a fossil resin."},
{i:199,k:"Ambush",t:"Joshua at the capture of Ai lay in ambush, and so deceived the inhabitants that he gained an easy victory (<r>Josh. 8:4-26</r>). Shechem was taken in this manner (<r>Judg. 9:30-45. Comp. Jer. 51:12</r>)."},
{i:200,k:"Amen",t:"This Hebrew word means firm, and hence also faithful (<r>Rev. 3:14</r>). In Isa. 65:16, the Authorized Version has 'the God of truth,' which in Hebrew is 'the God of Amen.' It is frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated 'verily.' Sometimes, only, however, in John's Gospel, it is repeated, 'Verily, verily.' It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ (<r>Rev. 3:14</r>)."},
{i:201,k:"Amethyst",t:"one of the precious stones in the breastplate of the high priest (<r>Ex. 28:19; 39:12</r>), and in the foundation of the New Jerusalem (<r>Rev. 21:20</r>). The ancients thought that this stone had the power of dispelling drunkenness in all who wore or touched it, and hence its Greek name formed from _a_, 'privative,' and _methuo_, 'to get drunk.' Its Jewish name, _ahlamah'_, was derived by the rabbins from the Hebrew word _halam_, 'to dream,' from its supposed power of causing the wearer to dream."},

{i:205,k:"Apocalypse",t:"the Greek name of the Book of Revelation (q.v.)."},
{i:206,k:"Apocrypha",t:"hidden, spurious, the name given to certain ancient books which found a place in the LXX. and Latin Vulgate versions of the Old Testament, and were appended to all the great translations made from them in the sixteenth century, but which have no claim to be regarded as in any sense parts of the inspired Word."},
{i:207,k:"Apollonia",t:"a city of Macedonia between Amphipolis and Thessalonica, from which it was distant about 36 miles. Paul and Silas passed through it on their way to Thessalonica (<r>Acts 17:1</r>)."},
{i:208,k:"Apollos",t:"a Jew 'born at Alexandria,' a man well versed in the Scriptures and eloquent (<r>Acts 18:24; R.V., 'learned'</r>). He came to Ephesus (about A.D. 49), where he spake 'boldly' in the synagogue (18:26), although he did not know as yet that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah. Aquila and Priscilla instructed him more perfectly in 'the way of God', i.e., in the knowledge of Christ. He then proceeded to Corinth, where he met Paul (<r>Acts 18:27; 19:1</r>). He was there very useful in watering the good seed Paul had sown (<r>1 Cor. 1:12</r>), and in gaining many to Christ. His disciples were much attached to him (<r>1 Cor. 3:4-7, 22</r>). He was with Paul at Ephesus when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians; and Paul makes kindly reference to him in his letter to Titus (3:13).

{i:210,k:"Apostle",t:"a person sent by another; a messenger; envoy. This word is once used as a descriptive designation of Jesus Christ, the Sent of the Father (<r>Heb. 3:1; John 20:21</r>). It is, however, generally used as designating the body of disciples to whom he intrusted the organization of his church and the dissemination of his gospel, 'the twelve,' as they are called (<r>Matt. 10:1-5; Mark 3:14; 6:7; Luke 6:13; 9:1</r>). We have four lists of the apostles, one by each of the synoptic evangelists (<r>Matt. 10:2-4; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14</r>), and one in the Acts (1:13). No two of these lists, however, perfectly coincide."},
{i:211,k:"Apothecary",t:"rendered in the margin and the Revised Version 'perfumer,' in Ex. 30:25; 37:29; Eccl. 10:1. The holy oils and ointments were prepared by priests properly qualified for this office. The feminine plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered 'confectionaries' in 1 Sam. 8:13."},
{i:212,k:"Apparel",t:"In Old Testament times the distinction between male and female attire was not very marked. The statute forbidding men to wear female apparel (<r>Deut. 22:5</r>) referred especially to ornaments and head-dresses. Both men and women wore (1) an under garment or tunic, which was bound by a girdle. One who had only this tunic on was spoken of as 'naked' (<r>1 Sam. 19:24; Job 24:10; Isa. 20:2</r>). Those in high stations sometimes wore two tunics, the outer being called the 'upper garment' (<r>1 Sam. 15:27; 18:4; 24:5; Job 1:20</r>). (2.) They wore in common an over-garment ('mantle,' Isa. 3:22; 1 Kings 19:13; 2 Kings 2:13), a loose and flowing robe. The folds of this upper garment could be formed into a lap (<r>Ruth 3:15; Ps. 79:12; Prov. 17:23; Luke 6:38</r>). Generals of armies usually wore scarlet robes (<r>Judg. 8:26; Nah. 2:3</r>). A form of conspicuous raiment is mentioned in Luke 20:46; comp. Matt. 23:5."},
{i:213,k:"Appeal",t:"a reference of any case from an inferior to a superior court. Moses established in the wilderness a series of judicatories such that appeals could be made from a lower to a higher (<r>Ex. 18:13-26.</r>)"},

{i:215,k:"Appii Forum",t:"i.e., 'the market of Appius' (<r>Acts 28:15, R.V.</r>), a town on the road, the 'Appian Way,' from Rome to Brundusium. It was 43 miles from Rome. Here Paul was met by some Roman Christians on his way to the capital. It was natural that they should halt here and wait for him, because from this place there were two ways by which travellers might journey to Rome."},
{i:216,k:"Apple",t:"(Heb. tappuah, meaning 'fragrance'). Probably the apricot or quince is intended by the word, as Palestine was too hot for the growth of apples proper. It is enumerated among the most valuable trees of Palestine (<r>Joel 1:12</r>), and frequently referred to in Canticles, and noted for its beauty (2:3, 5; 8:5). There is nothing to show that it was the 'tree of the knowledge of good and evil.' Dr. Tristram has suggested that the apricot has better claims than any other fruit-tree to be the apple of Scripture. It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass of glossy leaves, and bears an orange coloured fruit that gives out a delicious perfume. The 'apple of the eye' is the Heb. _ishon_, meaning manikin, i.e., the pupil of the eye (<r>Prov. 7:2</r>). (Comp. the promise, Zech. 2:8; the prayer, Ps. 17:8; and its fulfilment, Deut. 32:10.)"},
{i:217,k:"Apron",t:"found in the Authorized Version in Gen. 3:7, of the bands of fig-leaves made by our first parents. In Acts 19:12, it denotes the belt or half-girdle worn by artisans and servants round the waist for the purpose of preserving the clothing from injury. In marg. of Authorized Version, Ruth 3:15, correctly rendered instead of 'vail.' (R.V., 'mantle.')"},
{i:218,k:"Aquila",t:"eagle, a native of Pontus, by occupation a tent-maker, whom Paul met on his first visit to Corinth (<r>Acts 18:2</r>). Along with his wife Priscilla he had fled from Rome in consequence of a decree (A.D. 50) by Claudius commanding all Jews to leave the city. Paul sojourned with him at Corinth, and they wrought together at their common trade, making Cilician hair-cloth for tents. On Paul's departure from Corinth after eighteen months, Aquila and his wife accompanied him to Ephesus, where they remained, while he proceeded to Syria (<r>Acts 18:18, 26</r>). When they became Christians we are not informed, but in Ephesus they were (<r>1 Cor. 16:19</r>) Paul's 'helpers in Christ Jesus.' We find them afterwards at Rome (<r>Rom. 16:3</r>), interesting themselves still in the cause of Christ. They are referred to some years after this as being at Ephesus (<r>2 Tim. 4:19</r>). This is the last notice we have of them."},

{i:220,k:"Arabah",t:"plain, in the Revised Version of 2 Kings 14:25; Josh. 3:16; 8:14; 2 Sam. 2:29; 4:7 (in all these passages the A.V. has 'plain'); Amos 6:14 (A.V. 'wilderness'). This word is found in the Authorized Version only in Josh. 18:18. It denotes the hollow depression through which the Jordan flows from the Lake of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It is now called by the Arabs el-Ghor. But the Ghor is sometimes spoken of as extending 10 miles south of the Dead Sea, and thence to the Gulf of Akabah on the Red Sea is called the Wady el-Arabah."},
{i:221,k:"Arabia",t:"arid, an extensive region in the south-west of Asia. It is bounded on the west by the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the east by the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates. It extends far into the north in barren deserts, meeting those of Syria and Mesopotamia. It is one of the few countries of the world from which the original inhabitants have never been expelled."},
{i:222,k:"Arad",t:"(1.) Now Tell Arad, a Canaanite city, about 20 miles south of Hebron. The king of Arad 'fought against Israel and took of them prisoners' when they were retreating from the confines of Edom (<r>Num. 21:1; 33:40; Judg. 1:16</r>). It was finally subdued by Joshua (12:14)."},
{i:223,k:"Aram",t:"the son of Shem (<r>Gen. 10:22</r>); according to Gen. 22:21, a grandson of Nahor. In Matt. 1:3, 4, and Luke 3:33, this word is the Greek form of Ram, the father of Amminadab (<r>1 Chr. 2:10</r>)."},
{i:224,k:"Aram-naharaim",t:"Aram of the two rivers, is Mesopotamia (<r>as it is rendered in Gen. 24:10</r>), the country enclosed between the Tigris on the east and the Euphrates on the west (Ps. 60, title); called also the 'field of Aram' (<r>Hos. 12:12, R.V.</r>) i.e., the open country of Aram; in the Authorized Version, 'country of Syria.' Padan-aram (q.v.) was a portion of this country."},
{i:225,k:"Aram-zobah",t:"(Ps. 60, title), probably the region between the Euphrates and the Orontes."},
{i:226,k:"Aran",t:"wild goat, a descendant of Seir the Horite (<r>Gen. 36:28</r>)."},
{i:227,k:"Ararat",t:"sacred land or high land, the name of a country on one of the mountains of which the ark rested after the Flood subsided (<r>Gen. 8:4</r>). The 'mountains' mentioned were probably the Kurdish range of South Armenia. In 2 Kings 19:37, Isa. 37:38, the word is rendered 'Armenia' in the Authorized Version, but in the Revised Version, 'Land of Ararat.' In Jer. 51:27, the name denotes the central or southern portion of Armenia. It is, however, generally applied to a high and almost inaccessible mountain which rises majestically from the plain of the Araxes. It has two conical peaks, about 7 miles apart, the one 14,300 feet and the other 10,300 feet above the level of the plain. Three thousand feet of the summit of the higher of these peaks is covered with perpetual snow. It is called Kuh-i-nuh, i.e., 'Noah's mountain', by the Persians. This part of Armenia was inhabited by a people who spoke a language unlike any other now known, though it may have been related to the modern Georgian. About B.C. 900 they borrowed the cuneiform characters of Nineveh, and from this time we have inscriptions of a line of kings who at times contended with Assyria. At the close of the seventh century B.C. the kingdom of Ararat came to an end, and the country was occupied by a people who are ancestors of the Armenians of the present day."},
{i:228,k:"Araunah",t:"agile; also called Ornan 1 Chr. 21:15, a Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem before it was taken by the Israelites. The destroying angel, sent to punish David for his vanity in taking a census of the people, was stayed in his work of destruction near a threshing-floor belonging to Araunah which was situated on Mount Moriah. Araunah offered it to David as a free gift, together with the oxen and the threshing instruments; but the king insisted on purchasing it at its full price (<r>2 Sam. 24:24; 1 Chr. 21:24, 25</r>), for, according to the law of sacrifices, he could not offer to God what cost him nothing. On the same place Solomon afterwards erected the temple (<r>2 Sam. 24:16; 2 Chr. 3:1</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See ALTAR.</see>)"},
{i:229,k:"Arba",t:"four, a giant, father of Anak. From him the city of Hebron derived its name of Kirjath-arba, i.e., the city of Araba (<r>Josh. 14:15; 15:13; 21:11; Gen. 13:18; 23:2</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See HEBRON.</see>)"},
{i:230,k:"Arbathite",t:"a name given to Abi-albon, or, as elsewhere called, Abiel, one of David's warriors (<r>2 Sam. 23:31; 1 Chr. 11:32</r>), probably as being an inhabitant of Arabah (<r>Josh. 15:61</r>), a town in the wilderness of Judah."},
{i:231,k:"Arch",t:"an architectural term found only in Ezek. 40:16, 21, 22, 26, 29. There is no absolute proof that the Israelites employed arches in their buildings. The arch was employed in the building of the pyramids of Egypt. The oldest existing arch is at Thebes, and bears the date B.C. 1350. There are also still found the remains of an arch, known as Robinson's Arch, of the bridge connecting Zion and Moriah. (<see target='x-self'>See TYROPOEON VALLEY.</see>)"},

{i:233,k:"Archelaus",t:"ruler of the people, son of Herod the Great, by Malthace, a Samaritan woman. He was educated along with his brother Antipas at Rome. He inherited from his father a third part of his kingdom viz., Idumea, Judea, and Samaria, and hence is called 'king' (<r>Matt. 2:22</r>). It was for fear of him that Joseph and Mary turned aside on their way back from Egypt. Till a few days before his death Herod had named Antipas as his successor, but in his last moments he named Archelaus."},
{i:234,k:"Archer",t:"a shooter with the bow (<r>1 Chr. 10:3</r>). This art was of high antiquity (<r>Gen. 21:20; 27:3</r>). Saul was wounded by the Philistine archers (<r>1 Sam. 31:3</r>). The phrase 'breaking the bow' (<r>Hos. 1:5; Jer. 49:35</r>) is equivalent to taking away one's power, while 'strengthening the bow' is a symbol of its increase (<r>Gen. 49:24</r>). The Persian archers were famous among the ancients (<r>Isa. 13:18; Jer. 49:35; 50:9, 14, 29, 42.</r>) (<see target='x-self'>See BOW</see>)."},

{i:238,k:"Archite",t:"the usual designation of Hushai (<r>2 Sam. 15:32; 17:5, 14; 1 Chr. 27:33</r>), who was a native of Archi. He was 'the king's friend', i.e., he held office under David similar to that of our modern privy councillor."},
{i:239,k:"Arcturus",t:"bear-keeper, the name given by the ancients to the brightest star in the constellation Bootes. In the Authorized Version (<r>Job 9:9; 38:32</r>) it is the rendering of the Hebrew word _'ash_, which probably designates the constellation the Great Bear. This word ('ash) is supposed to be derived from an Arabic word meaning night-watcher, because the Great Bear always revolves about the pole, and to our nothern hemisphere never sets."},
{i:240,k:"Ard",t:"descent, a grandson of Benjamin (<r>Num. 26:38-40</r>). In 1 Chr. 8:3 he is called Addar. His descendants are mentioned in Num. 26:40."},

{i:243,k:"Areopagus",t:"the Latin form of the Greek word rendered 'Mars' hill.' But it denotes also the council or court of justice which met in the open air on the hill.

This led to a war between Aretas and Herod Antipas. Herod's army was wholly destroyed (A.D. 36). Aretas, taking advantage of the complications of the times on account of the death of the Emperor Tiberius (A.D. 37), took possession of Damascus (<r>2 Cor. 11:32; comp. Acts 9:25</r>). At this time Paul returned to Damascus from Arabia."},
{i:245,k:"Argob",t:"stony heap, an 'island,' as it has been called, of rock about 30 miles by 20, rising 20 or 30 feet above the table-land of Bashan; a region of crags and chasms wild and rugged in the extreme. On this 'island' stood sixty walled cities, ruled over by Og. It is called Trachonitis ('the rugged region') in the New Testament (<r>Luke 3:1</r>). These cities were conquered by the Israelites (<r>Deut. 3:4; 1 Kings 4:13</r>). It is now called the Lejah. Here 'sixty walled cities are still traceable in a space of 308 square miles. The architecture is ponderous and massive. Solid walls 4 feet thick, and stones on one another without cement; the roofs enormous slabs of basaltic rock, like iron; the doors and gates are of stone 18 inches thick, secured by ponderous bars. The land bears still the appearance of having been called the 'land of giants' under the giant Og.' 'I have more than once entered a deserted city in the evening, taken possession of a comfortable house, and spent the night in peace. Many of the houses in the ancient cities of Bashan are perfect, as if only finished yesterday. The walls are sound, the roofs unbroken, and even the window-shutters in their places.

Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel (<r>Deut. 23:4</r>). The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims (<r>Deut. 2:20; Gen. 14:5</r>). They are known as the Beni-ammi (<r>Gen. 19:38</r>), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from 'entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation' (<r>Deut. 23:3</r>). They afterwards became hostile to Israel (<r>Judg. 3:13</r>). Jephthah waged war against them, and 'took twenty cities with a very great slaughter' (<r>Judg. 11:33</r>). They were again signally defeated by Saul (<r>1 Sam. 11:11</r>). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians (<r>2 Sam. 10:6-14</r>), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil (<r>2 Sam. 10:14; 12:26-31</r>). The subsequent events of their history are noted in 2 Chr. 20:25; 26:8; Jer. 49:1; Ezek. 25:3, 6. One of Solomon's wives was Naamah, an Ammonite. She was the mother of Rehoboam (<r>1 Kings 14:31; 2 Chr. 12:13</r>)."},

{i:261,k:"Amorites",t:"highlanders, or hillmen, the name given to the descendants of one of the sons of Canaan (<r>Gen. 14:7</r>), called Amurra or Amurri in the Assyrian and Egyptian inscriptions. On the early Babylonian monuments all Syria, including Palestine, is known as 'the land of the Amorites.' The southern slopes of the mountains of Judea are called the 'mount of the Amorites' (<r>Deut. 1:7, 19, 20</r>). They seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea (<r>Gen. 14:7</r>) to Hebron (<r>13. Comp. 13:8; Deut. 3:8; 4:46-48</r>), embracing 'all Gilead and all Bashan' (<r>Deut. 3:10</r>), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river (4:49), the land of the 'two kings of the Amorites,' Sihon and Og (<r>Deut. 31:4; Josh. 2:10; 9:10</r>). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by Joshua (10:10). They were again defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining (<r>Josh. 11:8</r>). It is mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites (<r>1 Sam. 7:14</r>). The discrepancy supposed to exist between Deut. 1:44 and Num. 14:45 is explained by the circumstance that the terms 'Amorites' and 'Amalekites' are used synonymously for the 'Canaanites.' In the same way we explain the fact that the 'Hivites' of Gen. 34:2 are the 'Amorites' of 48:22. Comp. Josh. 10:6; 11:19 with 2 Sam. 21:2; also Num. 14:45 with Deut. 1:44. The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last 'of the remnant of the giants' (<r>Deut. 3:11</r>). Both Sihon and Og were independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language survives, 'Shenir,' the name they gave to Mount Hermon (<r>Deut. 3:9</r>)."},

In the days of Abraham (<r>Gen. 14:5, 6</r>) they inhabited the region afterwards known as Edom and Moab, east of the Jordan. They were probably a remnant of the original inhabitants of Palestine before the Canaanites, a Cushite tribe from Babel, and of the same race as the Phoenicians and the Egyptian shepherd kings. Their formidable warlike appearance, as described by the spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. They seem to have identified them with the Nephilim, the 'giants' (<r>Gen. 6:4; Num. 13:33</r>) of the antediluvian age. There were various tribes of Anakim (<r>Josh. 15:14</r>).

By common agreement the members of the early Christian community devoted their property to the work of furthering the gospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The proceeds of the possessions they sold were placed at the disposal of the apostles (<r>Acts 4:36, 37</r>). Ananias might have kept his property had he so chosen; but he professed agreement with the brethren in the common purpose, and had of his own accord devoted it all, as he said, to these sacred ends. Yet he retained a part of it for his own ends, and thus lied in declaring that he had given it all. 'The offence of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt of God, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter disregard of the corruption which they were bringing into the society.

{i:278,k:"Anathema",t:"anything laid up or suspended; hence anything laid up in a temple or set apart as sacred. In this sense the form of the word is _anath(ee)ma_, once in plural used in the Greek New Testament, in Luke 21:5, where it is rendered 'gifts.' In the LXX. the form _anathema_ is generally used as the rendering of the Hebrew word _herem_, derived from a verb which means (1) to consecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object so devoted to the Lord could not be redeemed (<r>Num. 18:14; Lev. 27:28, 29</r>); and hence the idea of exterminating connected with the word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used of the extermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide range of application. The _anathema_ or _herem_ was a person or thing irrevocably devoted to God (<r>Lev. 27:21, 28</r>); and 'none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death' (27:29). The word therefore carried the idea of devoted to destruction (<r>Num. 21:2, 3; Josh. 6:17</r>); and hence generally it meant a thing accursed. In Deut. 7:26 an idol is called a _herem_ = _anathema_, a thing accursed."},
{i:279,k:"Anathoth",t:"the name of one of the cities of refuge, in the tribe of Benjamin (<r>Josh. 21:18</r>). The Jews, as a rule, did not change the names of the towns they found in Palestine; hence this town may be regarded as deriving its name from the goddess Anat. It was the native place of Abiezer, one of David's 'thirty' (<r>2 Sam. 23:27</r>), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men (<r>1 Chr. 12:3</r>). It is chiefly notable, however, as the birth-place and usual residence of Jeremiah (<r>Jer. 1:1; 11:21-23; 29:27; 32:7-9</r>). It suffered greatly from the army of Sennacherib, and only 128 men returned to it from the Exile (<r>Neh. 7:27; Ezra 2:23</r>). It lay about 3 miles north of Jerusalem. It has been identified with the small and poor village of 'Anata, containing about 100 inhabitants."},

On one occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, 'Behold the Lamb of God' (<r>John 1:40</r>); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John's imprisonment (<r>Matt. 4:18, 19; Mark 1:16, 17</r>). Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the confidential disciples (<r>John 6:8; 12:22</r>), and with Peter, James, and John inquired of our Lord privately regarding his future coming (<r>Mark 13:3</r>). He was present at the feeding of the five thousand (<r>John 6:9</r>), and he introduced the Greeks who desired to see Jesus (<r>John 12:22</r>); but of his subsequent history little is known.

The common dill, the Anethum graveolens, is an annual growing wild in the cornfields of Spain and Portugal and the south of Europe generally. There is also a species of dill cultivated in Eastern countries known by the name of shubit. It was this species of garden plant of which the Pharisees were in the habit of paying tithes.

By the Mosaic law the high-priesthood was held for life (<r>Num. 3:10</r>); and although Annas had been deposed by the Roman procurator, the Jews may still have regarded him as legally the high priest. Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him (<r>John 18:19-23</r>) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place (<r>Matt. 26:57-68</r>).

The high priest and the king are thus called 'the anointed' (<r>Lev. 4:3, 5, 16; 6:20; Ps. 132:10</r>). Anointing a king was equivalent to crowning him (<r>1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 2:4, etc.</r>).

It was called the 'first city of the East.' Christianity was early introduced into it (<r>Acts 11:19, 21, 24</r>), and the name 'Christian' was first applied here to its professors (<r>Acts 11:26</r>).

{i:306,k:"Azazel",t:"(<r>Lev. 16:8, 10, 26, Revised Version only here; rendered 'scape-goat' in the Authorized Version</r>). This word has given rise to many different views. Some Jewish interpreters regard it as the name of a place some 12 miles east of Jerusalem, in the wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord 'laid the iniquity of us all,' and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz., 'separation'), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and the other, that 'for Azazel,' as representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat which was 'for Jehovah' was offered as a sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which was then 'sent away for Azazel' into the wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the dismissal of the 'scape-goat.' It was of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat 'for Jehovah' was to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so the goat 'for Azazel' was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin."},

The priests of Baal were in great numbers (<r>1 Kings 18:19</r>), and of various classes (<r>2 Kings 10:19</r>). Their mode of offering sacrifices is described in 1 Kings 18:25-29. The sun-god, under the general title of Baal, or 'lord,' was the chief object of worship of the Canaanites.

It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire.

Babylonia was divided into the two districts of Accad in the north, and Summer (probably the Shinar of the Old Testament) in the south.

Our translators seem to have been misled by the similarity in sound of the Hebrew _tachash_ and the Latin _taxus_, 'a badger.' The revisers have correctly substituted 'seal skins.' The Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula apply the name _tucash_ to the seals and dugongs which are common in the Red Sea, and the skins of which are largely used as leather and for sandals. Though the badger is common in Palestine, and might occur in the wilderness, its small hide would have been useless as a tent covering. The dugong, very plentiful in the shallow waters on the shores of the Red Sea, is a marine animal from 12 to 30 feet long, something between a whale and a seal, never leaving the water, but very easily caught.

From the time of their entering the land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining a bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., 'heroes'), and thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had an army of 3,000 select warriors (<r>1 Sam. 13:2; 14:52; 24:2</r>). David also had a band of soldiers around him (<r>1 Sam. 23:13; 25:13</r>).

The Lord gave him and his land rest and prosperity. It is recorded of him, however, that in his old age, when afflicted, he 'sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians' (<r>comp. Jer. 17:5</r>).

It was one of the chief seats of the worship of Dagon (<r>1 Sam. 5:5</r>). It belonged to the tribe of Judah (<r>Josh. 15:47</r>), but it never came into their actual possession. It was an important city, as it stood on the highroad from Egypt to Palestine, and hence was strongly fortified (<r>2 Chr. 26:6; Isa. 20:1</r>). Uzziah took it, but fifty years after his death it was taken by the Assyrians (B.C. 758). According to Sargon's record, it was captured by him in B.C. 711. The only reference to it in the New Testament, where it is called Azotus, is in the account of Philip's return from Gaza (<r>Acts 8:40</r>). It is now called Eshdud."},

The name Ashdoth is translated 'springs' in the Authorized Version, but 'slopes' in the Revised Version, of Josh. 10:40 and 12:8.

The place of this tribe during the march through the desert was between Dan and Naphtali (<r>Num. 2:27</r>). The boundaries of the inheritance given to it, which contained some of the richest soil in Palestine, and the names of its towns, are recorded in Josh. 19:24-31; Judg. 1:31, 32.

Such religious symbols ('groves') are frequently alluded to in Scripture (<r>Ex. 34:13; Judg. 6:25; 2 Kings 23:6; 1 Kings 16:33, etc.</r>).

It is mentioned on an inscription at Karnak in Egypt as having been taken by king Rameses II., the oppressor of the Hebrews. In the time of the judges (<r>Judg. 1:18</r>) it fell into the possession of the tribe of Judah; but it was soon after retaken by the Philistines (<r>2 Sam. 1:20</r>), who were not finally dispossessed till the time of Alexander the Great. Samson went down to this place from Timnath, and slew thirty men and took their spoil. The prophets foretold its destruction (<r>Jer. 25:20; 47:5, 7</r>). It became a noted place in the Middle Ages, having been the scene of many a bloody battle between the Saracens and the Crusaders. It was beseiged and taken by Richard the Lion-hearted, and 'within its walls and towers now standing he held his court.' Among the Tell Amarna tablets (<see target='x-self'>see EGYPT</see>) are found letters or official despatches from Yadaya, 'captain of horse and dust of the king's feet,' to the 'great king' of Egypt, dated from Ascalon.

Uzzia, one of David's valiant men (<r>1 Chr. 11:44</r>), is named as of this city. It is identified with Tell Ashterah, in the Hauran, and is noticed on monuments B.C. 1700-1500.

These names often occur in the plural (Ashtaroth, Baalim), probably as indicating either different statues or different modifications of the deities. This deity is spoken of as Ashtoreth of the Zidonians. She was the Ishtar of the Accadians and the Astarte of the Greeks (<r>Jer. 44:17; 1 Kings 11:5, 33; 2 Kings 23:13</r>). There was a temple of this goddess among the Philistines in the time of Saul (<r>1 Sam. 31:10</r>). Under the name of Ishtar, she was one of the great deities of the Assyrians. The Phoenicians called her Astarte. Solomon introduced the worship of this idol (<r>1 Kings 11:33</r>). Jezebel's 400 priests were probably employed in its service (<r>1 Kings 18:19</r>).

Proconsular Asia contained the seven churches of the Apocalypse (<r>Rev. 1:11</r>).

He was 'luxurious, ambitious, and cruel, but a magnificent patron of literature.' He formed at Nineveh a library of clay tablets, numbering about 10,000. These are now mostly in the British Museum. They throw much light on the history and antiquities of Assyria."},

The Egyptians worshipped it as the _uraeus_, and it was found in the desert and in the fields. The peace and security of Messiah's reign is represented by the figure of a child playing on the hole of the asp. (See ADDER"},

'athon), so named from its slowness (<r>Gen. 12:16; 45:23; Num. 22:23; 1 Sam. 9:3</r>). (2.) The male ass (Heb. hamor), the common working ass of Western Asia, so called from its red colour. Issachar is compared to a strong ass (<r>Gen. 49:14</r>). It was forbidden to yoke together an ass and an ox in the plough (<r>Deut. 22:10</r>). (3.) The ass's colt (Heb. 'air), mentioned Judg. 10:4; 12:14. It is rendered 'foal' in Gen. 32:15; 49:11. (<r>Comp. Job 11:12; Isa. 30:6.</r>) The ass is an unclean animal, because it does not chew the cud (<r>Lev. 11:26.

He probably gave his name to Assyria, which is the usual translation of the word, although the form Asshur is sometimes retained (<r>Num. 24:22, 24; Ezek. 27:23, etc.</r>). In Gen. 2:14 'Assyria' ought to be 'Asshur,' which was the original capital of Assyria, a city represented by the mounds of Kalah Sherghat, on the west bank of the Tigris. This city was founded by Bel-kap-kapu about B.C. 1700. At a later date the capital was shifted to Ninua, or Nineveh, now Koyunjik, on the eastern bank of the river.

The island of Lesbos lay opposite it, about 7 miles distant."},
{i:397,k:"Assurance",t:"The resurrection of Jesus (<r>Acts 17:31</r>) is the 'assurance' (Gr. pistis, generally rendered 'faith') or pledge God has given that his revelation is true and worthy of acceptance. The 'full assurance [Gr. plerophoria, 'full bearing'] of faith' (<r>Heb. 10:22</r>) is a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. The 'full assurance of understanding' (<r>Col. 2:2</r>) is an entire unwavering conviction of the truth of the declarations of Scripture, a joyful steadfastness on the part of any one of conviction that he has grasped the very truth. The 'full assurance of hope' (<r>Heb. 6:11</r>) is a sure and well-grounded expectation of eternal glory (<r>2 Tim. 4:7, 8</r>). This assurance of hope is the assurance of a man's own particular salvation."},
{i:398,k:"Assyria",t:"the name derived from the city Asshur on the Tigris, the original capital of the country, was originally a colony from Babylonia, and was ruled by viceroys from that kingdom. It was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia.

On the death of her husband and of her son Ahaziah, she resolved to seat herself on the vacant throne. She slew all Ahaziah's children except Joash, the youngest (<r>2 Kings 11:1,2</r>). After a reign of six years she was put to death in an insurrection (<r>2 Kings 11:20; 2 Chr. 21:6; 22:10-12; 23:15</r>), stirred up among the people in connection with Josiah's being crowned as king."},

In order that this law might be guarded against abuse, Moses appointed six cities of refuge (<r>Ex. 21:13; Num. 35:13; Deut. 19:1,9</r>). These were in different parts of the country, and every facility was afforded the manslayer that he might flee to the city that lay nearest him for safety. Into the city of refuge the avenger durst not follow him. This arrangement applied only to cases where the death was not premeditated. The case had to be investigated by the authorities of the city, and the wilful murderer was on no account to be spared. He was regarded as an impure and polluted person, and was delivered up to the _goel_ (<r>Deut. 19:11-13</r>).

In 2 Kings 6:5 it is the translation of a word used with reference to its being made of iron. In Isa. 44:12 the Revised Version renders by 'axe' the Hebrew _maatsad_, which means a 'hewing' instrument. In the Authorized Version it is rendered 'tongs.' It is also used in Jer. 10:3, and rendered 'axe.' The 'battle-axe' (army of Medes and Persians) mentioned in Jer. 51:20 was probably, as noted in the margin of the Revised Version, a 'maul' or heavy mace.

{i:428,k:"Berodach-baladan",t:"the king of Babylon who sent a friendly deputation to Hezekiah (<r>2 Kings 20:12</r>). In Isa. 39:1 he is called Merodach-baladan (q.v.)."},
{i:429,k:"Beryl",t:"the rendering in the Authorized Version of the Hebrew word _tarshish_, a precious stone; probably so called as being brought from Tarshish. It was one of the stones on the breastplate of the high priest (<r>Ex. 28:20; R.V. marg., 'chalcedony;' 39:13</r>). The colour of the wheels in Ezekiel's vision was as the colour of a beryl stone (1:16; 10:9; R.V., 'stone of Tarshish'). It is mentioned in Cant. 5:14; Dan. 10:6; Rev. 21:20. In Ezek. 28:13 the LXX. render the word by 'chrysolite,' which the Jewish historian Josephus regards as its proper translation. This also is the rendering given in the Authorized Version in the margin. That was a gold-coloured gem, the topaz of ancient authors."},

In Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5 it stands for 'Bethel' (q.v.), and it is so called because it was no longer the 'house of God,' but 'the house of idols,' referring to the calves there worshipped."},
{i:441,k:"Beth-barah",t:"house of crossing, a place south of the scene of Gideon's victory (<r>Judg. 7:24</r>). It was probably the chief ford of the Jordan in that district, and may have been that by which Jacob crossed when he returned from Mesopotamia, near the Jabbok (<r>Gen. 32:22</r>), and at which Jephthah slew the Ephraimites (<r>Judg. 12:4</r>).

They are distinguished as Beth-horon 'the upper' and Beth-horon 'the nether.' They are about 2 miles apart, the former being about 10 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Between the two places was the ascent and descent of Beth-horon, leading from Gibeon down to the western plain (<r>Josh. 10:10, 11; 18:13, 14</r>), down which the five kings of the Amorites were driven by Joshua in that great battle, the most important in which the Hebrews had been as yet engaged, being their first conflict with their enemies in the open field. Jehovah interposed in behalf of Israel by a terrific hailstorm, which caused more deaths among the Canaanites than did the swords of the Israelites. Beth-horon is mentioned as having been taken by Shishak, B.C. 945, in the list of his conquests, and the pass was the scene of a victory of Judas Maccabeus. (<r>Comp. Ex. 9:19, 25; Job 38:22, 23; Ps. 18:12-14; Isa. 30:30.</r>) The modern name of these places is Beit-ur, distinguished by el-Foka, 'the upper,' and el-Tahta, 'the nether.' The lower was at the foot of the pass, and the upper, 500 feet higher, at the top, west of Gibeon. (<see target='x-self'>See GIBEON.</see>)"},

{i:453,k:"Beth-shean",t:"house of security or rest, a city which belonged to Manasseh (<r>1 Chr. 7:29</r>), on the west of Jordan. The bodies of Saul and his sons were fastened to its walls. In Solomon's time it gave its name to a district (<r>1 Kings 4:12</r>). The name is found in an abridged form, Bethshan, in 1 Sam. 31:10, 12 and 2 Sam. 21:12. It is on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, about 5 miles from the Jordan, and 14 from the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret. After the Captivity it was called Scythopolis, i.e., 'the city of the Scythians,' who about B.C. 640 came down from the steppes of Southern Russia and settled in different places in Syria. It is now called Beisan."},

It was the scene of an encounter between Jehoash, king of Israel, and Amaziah, king of Judah, in which the latter was made prisoner (<r>2 Kings 14:11, 13</r>). It was afterwards taken by the Philistines (<r>2 Chr. 28:18</r>). It is the modern ruined Arabic village 'Ain-shems, on the north-west slopes of the mountains of Judah, 14 miles west of Jerusalem."},

It may be identical with Bethbarah, the ancient ford of Jordan of which the men of Ephraim took possession (<r>Judg. 7:24</r>). The Revised Version reads 'Bethany beyond Jordan.' It was the great ford, and still bears the name of 'the ford,' Makhadhet 'Abarah, 'the ford of crossing over,' about 25 miles from Nazareth. (<see target='x-self'>See BETHBARAH.</see>)"},
{i:457,k:"Bethany",t:"house of dates. (1.) The Revised Version in John 1:28 has this word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan."},
{i:458,k:"Bethel",t:"house of God. (1.) A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz (<r>Gen. 28:19</r>). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai (<r>Gen. 12:8</r>); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again 'called upon the name of the Lord' (13:4). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven (28:10, 19); and on his return he again visited this place, 'where God talked with him' (35:1-15), and there he 'built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el' (q.v.). To this second occasion of God's speaking with Jacob at Bethel, Hosea (12:4,5) makes reference."},

He resided at Pethor (<r>Deut. 23:4</r>), in Mesopotamia (<r>Num. 23:7</r>). It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam 'from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,' to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak's wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers (<r>2 Pet. 2:15, 16</r>) to this as an historical event. In Micah 6:5 reference also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them (Num. 25). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting on the side of Balak (<r>Num. 31:8</r>)."},

{i:467,k:"Balance",t:"occurs in Lev. 19:36 and Isa. 46:6, as the rendering of the Hebrew _kanch'_, which properly means 'a reed' or 'a cane,' then a rod or beam of a balance. This same word is translated 'measuring reed' in Ezek. 40:3,5; 42:16-18. There is another Hebrew word, _mozena'yim_, i.e., 'two poisers', also so rendered (<r>Dan. 5:27</r>). The balances as represented on the most ancient Egyptian monuments resemble those now in use. A 'pair of balances' is a symbol of justice and fair dealing (<r>Job 31:6; Ps. 62:9; Prov. 11:1</r>). The expression denotes great want and scarcity in Rev. 6:5."},

It was included apparently under 'scab' and 'scurf,' which disqualified for the priesthood (<r>Lev. 21:20</r>). The Egyptians were rarely subject to it. This probably arose from their custom of constantly shaving the head, only allowing the hair to grow as a sign of mourning. With the Jews artificial baldness was a sign of mourning (<r>Isa. 22:12; Jer. 7:29; 16:6</r>); it also marked the conclusion of a Nazarite's vow (<r>Acts 18:18; 21:24; Num. 6:9</r>). It is often alluded to (<r>Micah 1:16; Amos 8:10; Jer. 47:5</r>). The Jews were forbidden to follow the customs of surrounding nations in making themselves bald (<r>Deut. 14:1</r>)."},

Some also regard the statement here as an allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said, to prevail at Corinth, in which a person was baptized in the stead of others who had died before being baptized, to whom it was hoped some of the benefits of that rite would be extended. This they think may have been one of the erroneous customs which Paul went to Corinth to 'set in order.'"},

Luke speaks of him as a 'good man' (11:24). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land (<r>Acts 4:36, 37</r>), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding (<r>Acts 14:11, 12</r>). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (9:27). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel."},
{i:496,k:"Barrel",t:"a vessel used for keeping flour (<r>1 Kings 17:12, 14, 16</r>). The same word (cad) so rendered is also translated 'pitcher,' a vessel for carrying water (<r>Gen. 24:14; Judg. 7:16</r>)."},

{i:498,k:"Barsabas",t:"son of Saba, the surname (1) of Joseph, also called Justus (<r>Acts 1:23</r>), some identify him with Barnabas; (2) of Judas, who was a 'prophet.' Nothing more is known of him than what is mentioned in Acts 15:32."},
{i:499,k:"Bartholomew",t:"son of Tolmai, one of the twelve apostles (<r>Matt. 10:3; Acts 1:13</r>); generally supposed to have been the same as Nathanael. In the synoptic gospels Philip and Bartholomew are always mentioned together, while Nathanael is never mentioned; in the fourth gospel, on the other hand, Philip and Nathanael are similarly mentioned together, but nothing is said of Bartholomew. He was one of the disciples to whom our Lord appeared at the Sea of Tiberias after his resurrection (<r>John 21:2</r>). He was also a witness of the Ascension (<r>Acts 1:4, 12, 13</r>).

{i:500,k:"Bartimaeus",t:"son of Timaeus, one of the two blind beggars of Jericho (<r>Mark 10:46; Matt. 20:30</r>). His blindness was miraculously cured on the ground of his faith."},
{i:501,k:"Baruch",t:"blessed. (1.) The secretary of the prophet Jeremiah (32:12; 36:4). He was of the tribe of Judah (51:59). To him Jeremiah dictated his prophecies regarding the invasion of the Babylonians and the Captivity. These he read to the people from a window in the temple in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah (Jer. 36). He afterwards read them before the counsellors of the king at a private interview; and then to the king himself, who, after hearing a part of the roll, cut it with a penknife, and threw it into the fire of his winter parlour, where he was sitting."},

{i:503,k:"Bashan",t:"light soil, first mentioned in Gen. 14:5, where it is said that Chedorlaomer and his confederates 'smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth,' where Og the king of Bashan had his residence. At the time of Israel's entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed (<r>Num. 21:33-35; Deut. 3:1-7</r>). This country extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<r>Josh. 13:29-31</r>). Golan, one of its cities, became a 'city of refuge' (<r>Josh. 21:27</r>). Argob, in Bashan, was one of Solomon's commissariat districts (<r>1 Kings 4:13</r>). The cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael (<r>2 Kings 10:33</r>), but were soon after reconquered by Jehoash (<r>2 Kings 13:25</r>), who overcame the Syrians in three battles, according to the word of Elisha (19). From this time Bashan almost disappears from history, although we read of the wild cattle of its rich pastures (<r>Ezek. 39:18; Ps. 22:12</r>), the oaks of its forests (<r>Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 27:6; Zech. 11:2</r>), and the beauty of its extensive plains (<r>Amos 4:1; Jer. 50:19</r>). Soon after the conquest, the name 'Gilead' was given to the whole country beyond Jordan. After the Exile, Bashan was divided into four districts, (1.) Gaulonitis, or Jaulan, the most western; (2.) Auranitis, the Hauran (<r>Ezek. 47:16</r>); (3.) Argob or Trachonitis, now the Lejah; and (4.) Batanaea, now Ard-el-Bathanyeh, on the east of the Lejah, with many deserted towns almost as perfect as when they were inhabited. (<see target='x-self'>See HAURAN.</see>)"},

It is noticeable that Esau's three wives receive different names in the genealogical table of the Edomites (Gen. 36) from those given to them in the history (<r>Gen. 26:34; 28:9</r>)."},
{i:507,k:"Basilisk",t:"(in R.V., Isa. 11:8; 14:29; 59:5; Jer. 8:17), the 'king serpent,' as the name imports; a fabulous serpent said to be three spans long, with a spot on its head like a crown. Probably the yellow snake is intended. (<see target='x-self'>See COCKATRICE.</see>)"},
{i:508,k:"Basin",t:"or Bason. (1.) A trough or laver (Heb. aggan') for washing (<r>Ex. 24:6</r>); rendered also 'goblet' (<r>Cant. 7:2</r>) and 'cups' (<r>Isa. 22:24</r>)."},
{i:509,k:"Basket",t:"There are five different Hebrew words so rendered in the Authorized Version: (1.) A basket (Heb. sal, a twig or osier) for holding bread (<r>Gen. 40:16; Ex. 29:3, 23; Lev. 8:2, 26, 31; Num. 6:15, 17, 19</r>). Sometimes baskets were made of twigs peeled; their manufacture was a recognized trade among the Hebrews."},
{i:510,k:"Bastard",t:"In the Old Testament the rendering of the Hebrew word _mamzer'_, which means 'polluted.' In Deut. 23:2, it occurs in the ordinary sense of illegitimate offspring. In Zech. 9:6, the word is used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of Jephthah we learn that there were bastard offspring among the Jews (<r>Judg. 11:1-7</r>). In Heb. 12:8, the word (Gr. nothoi) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those who do not share the privileges of God's children."},
{i:511,k:"Bastinado",t:"beating, a mode of punishment common in the East. It is referred to by 'the rod of correction' (<r>Prov. 22:15</r>), 'scourging' (<r>Lev. 19:20</r>), 'chastising' (<r>Deut. 22:18</r>). The number of blows could not exceed forty (<r>Deut. 25:2, 3</r>)."},
{i:512,k:"Bat",t:"The Hebrew word (atalleph') so rendered (<r>Lev. 11:19; Deut. 14:18</r>) implies 'flying in the dark.' The bat is reckoned among the birds in the list of unclean animals. To cast idols to the 'moles and to the bats' means to carry them into dark caverns or desolate places to which these animals resort (<r>Isa. 2:20</r>), i.e., to consign them to desolation or ruin."},
{i:513,k:"Bath",t:"a Hebrew liquid measure, the tenth part of an homer (<r>1 Kings 7:26, 38; Ezek. 45:10, 14</r>). It contained 8 gallons 3 quarts of our measure. 'Ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath' (<r>Isa. 5:10</r>) denotes great unproductiveness."},
{i:514,k:"Bath-rabbim",t:"daughter of many, the name of one of the gates of the city of Heshbon, near which were pools (<r>Cant.7:4</r>)."},
{i:515,k:"Bath-sheba",t:"daughter of the oath, or of seven, called also Bath-shu'a (<r>1 Chr. 3:5</r>), was the daughter of Eliam (<r>2 Sam. 11:3</r>) or Ammiel (<r>1 Chr. 3:5</r>), and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David committed adultery with her (<r>2 Sam. 11:4, 5; Ps. 51:1</r>). The child born in adultery died (<r>2 Sam. 12:15-19</r>). After her husband was slain (11:15) she was married to David (11:27), and became the mother of Solomon (12:24; 1 Kings 1:11; 2:13). She took a prominent part in securing the succession of Solomon to the throne (<r>1 Kings 1:11, 16-21</r>)."},
{i:516,k:"Baths",t:"The use of the bath was very frequent among the Hebrews (<r>Lev. 14:8; Num. 19:19, ect.</r>). The high priest at his inauguration (<r>Lev. 8:6</r>), and on the day of atonement, was required to bathe himself (16:4, 24). The 'pools' mentioned in Neh. 3:15, 16, 2 Kings 20:20, Isa. 22:11, John 9:7, were public bathing-places."},
{i:517,k:"Battering-ram",t:"(<r>Ezek. 4:2; 21:22</r>), a military engine, consisting of a long beam of wood hung upon a frame, for making breaches in walls. The end of it which was brought against the wall was shaped like a ram's head."},

{i:519,k:"Battle-bow",t:"the war-bow used in fighting (<r>Zech. 9:10; 10:4</r>). 'Thy bow was made quite naked' (<r>Hab. 3:9</r>) means that it was made ready for use.

{i:520,k:"Battlement",t:"a parapet wall or balustrade surrounding the flat roofs of the houses, required to be built by a special law (<r>Deut. 22:8</r>). In Jer. 5:10, it denotes the parapet of a city wall."},
{i:521,k:"Bay",t:"denotes the estuary of the Dead Sea at the mouth of the Jordan (<r>Josh. 15:5; 18:19</r>), also the southern extremity of the same sea (15:2). The same Hebrew word is rendered 'tongue' in Isa. 11:15, where it is used with reference to the forked mouths of the Nile."},
{i:522,k:"Bay tree",t:"named only in Ps. 37:35, Authorized Version. The Hebrew word so rendered is _ereh_, which simply means 'native born', i.e., a tree not transplanted, but growing on its native soil, and therefore luxuriantly. If the psalmist intended by this word to denote any particular tree, it may have been the evergreen bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), which is a native of Palestine. Instead of 'like a green bay tree' in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version has, 'like a green tree in its native soil.'"},
{i:523,k:"Bdellium",t:"occurs only in Gen. 2:12, where it designates a product of the land of Havilah; and in Num. 11:7, where the manna is likened to it in colour. It was probably an aromatic gum like balsam which exuded from a particular tree (Borassus flabelliformis) still found in Arabia, Media, and India. It bears a resemblance in colour to myrrh. Others think the word denotes 'pearls,' or some precious stone."},
{i:524,k:"Beacon",t:"a pole (Heb. to'ren) used as a standard or ensign set on the tops of mountains as a call to the people to assemble themselves for some great national purpose (<r>Isa. 30:17</r>). In Isa. 33:23 and Ezek. 27:5, the same word is rendered 'mast.' (See Banner"},

{i:526,k:"Bealoth",t:"citizens, a town in the extreme south of Judah (<r>Josh. 15:24</r>); probably the same as Baalath-beer (19:8). In 1 Kings 4:16, the Authorized Version has 'in Aloth,' the Revised Version 'Bealoth.'"},
{i:527,k:"Beam",t:"occurs in the Authorized Version as the rendering of various Hebrew words. In 1 Sam. 17:7, it means a weaver's frame or principal beam; in Hab. 2:11, a crossbeam or girder; 2 Kings 6:2, 5, a cross-piece or rafter of a house; 1 Kings 7:6, an architectural ornament as a projecting step or moulding; Ezek. 41:25, a thick plank. In the New Testament the word occurs only in Matt. 7:3, 4, 5, and Luke 6:41, 42, where it means (Gr. dokos) a large piece of wood used for building purposes, as contrasted with 'mote' (Gr. karphos), a small piece or mere splinter. 'Mote' and 'beam' became proverbial for little and great faults."},
{i:528,k:"Beans",t:"mentioned in 2 Sam. 17:28 as having been brought to David when flying from Absalom. They formed a constituent in the bread Ezekiel (4:9) was commanded to make, as they were in general much used as an article of diet. They are extensively cultivated in Egypt and Arabia and Syria."},
{i:529,k:"Bear",t:"a native of the mountain regions of Western Asia, frequently mentioned in Scripture. David defended his flocks against the attacks of a bear (<r>1 Sam. 17:34-37</r>). Bears came out of the wood and destroyed the children who mocked the prophet Elisha (<r>2 Kings 2:24</r>). Their habits are referred to in Isa. 59:11; Prov. 28:15; Lam. 3:10. The fury of the female bear when robbed of her young is spoken of (<r>2 Sam. 17:8; Prov. 17:12; Hos. 13:8</r>). In Daniel's vision of the four great monarchies, the Medo-Persian empire is represented by a bear (7:5)."},
{i:530,k:"Beard",t:"The mode of wearing it was definitely prescribed to the Jews (<r>Lev. 19:27; 21:5</r>). Hence the import of Ezekiel's (5:1-4) description of the 'razor' i.e., the agents of an angry providence being used against the guilty nation of the Jews. It was a part of a Jew's daily toilet to anoint his beard with oil and perfume (<r>Ps. 133:2</r>). Beards were trimmed with the most fastidious care (<r>2 Sam. 19:24</r>), and their neglet was an indication of deep sorrow (<r>Isa. 15:2; Jer. 41:5</r>). The custom was to shave or pluck off the hair as a sign of mourning (<r>Isa. 50:6; Jer. 48:37; Ezra 9:3</r>). The beards of David's ambassadors were cut off by hanun (<r>2 Sam. 10:4</r>) as a mark of indignity."},
{i:531,k:"Beast",t:"This word is used of flocks or herds of grazing animals (<r>Ex. 22:5; Num. 20:4, 8, 11; Ps. 78:48</r>); of beasts of burden (<r>Gen. 45:17</r>); of eatable beasts (<r>Prov. 9:2</r>); and of swift beasts or dromedaries (<r>Isa. 60:6</r>). In the New Testament it is used of a domestic animal as property (<r>Rev. 18:13</r>); as used for food (<r>1 Cor. 15:39</r>), for service (<r>Luke 10:34; Acts 23:24</r>), and for sacrifice (<r>Acts 7:42</r>)."},
{i:532,k:"Beaten gold",t:"in Num. 8:4, means 'turned' or rounded work in gold. The Greek Version, however, renders the word 'solid gold;' the Revised Version, 'beaten work of gold.' In 1 Kings 10:16, 17, it probably means 'mixed' gold, as the word ought to be rendered, i.e., not pure gold. Others render the word in these places 'thin plates of gold.'"},
{i:533,k:"Beaten oil",t:"(<r>Ex. 27:20; 29:40</r>), obtained by pounding olives in a mortar, not by crushing them in a mill. It was reckoned the best. (See OLIVE"},

{i:535,k:"Becher",t:"first-born; a youth, the second son of Benjamin (<r>Gen. 46:21</r>), who came down to Egypt with Jacob. It is probable that he married an Ephraimitish heiress, and that his descendants were consequently reckoned among the tribe of Ephraim (<r>Num. 26:35; 1 Chr. 7:20, 21</r>).

Another Hebrew word (er'es) so rendered denotes a canopied bed, or a bed with curtains (<r>Deut. 3:11; Ps. 132:3</r>), for sickness (<r>Ps. 6:6; 41:3</r>)."},
{i:537,k:"Bed-chamber",t:"an apartment in Eastern houses, furnished with a slightly elevated platform at the upper end and sometimes along the sides, on which were laid mattresses.

In 2 Kings 11:2 this word denotes, as in the margin of the Revised Version, a store-room in which mattresses were kept."},
{i:538,k:"Bedan",t:"one of the judges of Israel (<r>1 Sam. 12:11</r>). It is uncertain who he was. Some suppose that Barak is meant, others Samson, but most probably this is a contracted form of Abdon (<r>Judg. 12:13</r>)."},

{i:540,k:"Bee",t:"First mentioned in Deut. 1:44. Swarms of bees, and the danger of their attacks, are mentioned in Ps. 118:12. Samson found a 'swarm of bees' in the carcass of a lion he had slain (<r>Judg. 14:8</r>). Wild bees are described as laying up honey in woods and in clefts of rocks (<r>Deut. 32:13; Ps. 81:16</r>).

{i:546,k:"Beeroth",t:"wells, one of the four cities of the Hivites which entered by fraud into a league with Joshua. It belonged to Benjamin (<r>Josh. 18:25</r>). It has by some been identified with el-Bireh on the way to Nablus, 10 miles north of Jerusalem."},

{i:548,k:"Beersheba",t:"well of the oath, or well of seven, a well dug by Abraham, and so named because he and Abimelech here entered into a compact (<r>Gen. 21:31</r>). On re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name (<r>Gen. 26:31-33</r>). It was a favourite place of abode of both of these patriarchs (21:33-22:1, 19; 26:33; 28:10). It is mentioned among the 'cities' given to the tribe of Simeon (<r>Josh. 19:2; 1 Chr. 4:28</r>). From Dan to Beersheba, a distance of about 144 miles (<r>Judg. 20:1; 1 Chr. 21:2; 2 Sam. 24:2</r>), became the usual way of designating the whole Promised Land, and passed into a proverb. After the return from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into 'from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom' (<r>Neh. 11:30</r>). The kingdom of the ten tribes extended from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim (<r>2 Chr. 19:4</r>). The name is not found in the New Testament. It is still called by the Arabs Bir es-Seba, i.e., 'well of the seven', where there are to the present day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It is nearly midway between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean."},
{i:549,k:"Beetle",t:"(Heb. hargol, meaning 'leaper'). Mention of it is made only in Lev. 11:22, where it is obvious the word cannot mean properly the beetle. It denotes some winged creeper with at least four feet, 'which has legs above its feet, to leap withal.' The description plainly points to the locust (q.v.).

It is translated 'wicked' in Deut. 15:9; Ps. 41:8 (R.V. marg.); 101:3; Prov. 6:12, etc. The expression 'son' or 'man of Belial' means simply a worthless, lawless person (<r>Judg. 19:22; 20:13; 1 Sam. 1:16; 2:12</r>)."},
{i:558,k:"Bell",t:"The bells first mentioned in Scripture are the small golden bells attached to the hem of the high priest's ephod (<r>Ex. 28:33, 34, 35</r>). The 'bells of the horses' mentioned by Zechariah (14:20) were attached to the bridles or belts round the necks of horses trained for war, so as to accustom them to noise and tumult."},

{i:560,k:"Belly",t:"the seat of the carnal affections (<r>Titus 1:12; Phil. 3:19; Rom. 16:18</r>). The word is used symbolically for the heart (<r>Prov. 18:8; 20:27; 22:18, marg.</r>). The 'belly of hell' signifies the grave or underworld (<r>Jonah 2:2</r>)."},
{i:561,k:"Belshazzar",t:"Bel protect the king!, the last of the kings of Babylon (<r>Dan. 5:1</r>). He was the son of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and the widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still young he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and when heated with wine sent for the sacred vessels his 'father' (<r>Dan. 5:2</r>), or grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in Jerusalem, and he and his princes drank out of them. In the midst of their mad revelry a hand was seen by the king tracing on the wall the announcement of God's judgment, which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the queen (i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he interpreted the writing. That night the kingdom of the Chaldeans came to an end, and the king was slain (<r>Dan. 5:30</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See NERGAL-SHAREZER.</see>)"},

{i:565,k:"Benaiah",t:"built up by Jehovah. (1.) The son of Jehoiada, chief priest (<r>1 Chr. 27:5</r>). He was set by David over his body-guard of Cherethites and Pelethites (<r>2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kings 1:32; 1 Chr. 18:17</r>). His exploits are enumerated in 2 Sam. 23:20, 21, 22; 1 Chr. 11:22. He remained faithful to Solomon (<r>1 Kings 1:8, 10, 26</r>), by whom he was raised to the rank of commander-in-chief (<r>1 Kings 2:25, 29, 30, 34, 35; 4:4</r>)."},

Eusebius the historian (A.D. 330) calls it 'the sheep-pool.' It is also called 'Bethsaida' and 'Beth-zatha' (<r>John 5:2, R.V. marg.</r>). Under these 'porches' or colonnades were usually a large number of infirm people waiting for the 'troubling of the water.' It is usually identified with the modern so-called Fountain of the Virgin, in the valley of the Kidron, and not far from the Pool of Siloam (q.v.); and also with the Birket Israel, a pool near the mouth of the valley which runs into the Kidron south of 'St. Stephen's Gate.' Others again identify it with the twin pools called the 'Souterrains,' under the convent of the Sisters of Zion, situated in what must have been the rock-hewn ditch between Bezetha and the fortress of Antonia. But quite recently Schick has discovered a large tank, as sketched here, situated about 100 feet north-west of St. Anne's Church, which is, as he contends, very probably the Pool of Bethesda. No certainty as to its identification, however, has as yet been arrived at. (<see target='x-self'>See FOUNTAIN; GIHON.</see>)"},
{i:569,k:"Bethlehem",t:"house of bread. (1.) A city in the 'hill country' of Judah. It was originally called Ephrath (<r>Gen. 35:16, 19; 48:7; Ruth 4:11</r>). It was also called Beth-lehem Ephratah (<r>Micah 5:2</r>), Beth-lehem-judah (<r>1 Sam. 17:12</r>), and 'the city of David' (<r>Luke 2:4</r>). It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where Rachel died and was buried 'by the wayside,' directly to the north of the city (<r>Gen. 48:7</r>). The valley to the east was the scene of the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town. Here was David's birth-place, and here also, in after years, he was anointed as king by Samuel (<r>1 Sam. 16:4-13</r>); and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam (<r>2 Sam. 23:13-17</r>). But it was distinguished above every other city as the birth-place of 'Him whose goings forth have been of old' (<r>Matt. 2:6; comp. Micah 5:2</r>). Afterwards Herod, 'when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,' sent and slew 'all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under' (<r>Matt. 2:16, 18; Jer. 31:15</r>)."},
{i:570,k:"Bethsaida",t:"house of fish. (1.) A town in Galilee, on the west side of the sea of Tiberias, in the 'land of Gennesaret.' It was the native place of Peter, Andrew, and Philip, and was frequently resorted to by Jesus (<r>Mark 6:45; John 1:44; 12:21</r>). It is supposed to have been at the modern 'Ain Tabighah, a bay to the north of Gennesaret."},

{i:572,k:"Bethzur",t:"house of rock, a town in the mountains of Judah (<r>Josh. 15:58</r>), about 4 miles to the north of Hebron. It was built by Rehoboam for the defence of his kingdom (<r>2 Chr. 11:7</r>). It stood near the modern ed-Dirweh. Its ruins are still seen on a hill which bears the name of Beit-Sur, and which commands the road from Beer-sheba and Hebron to Jerusalem from the south."},
{i:573,k:"Betroth",t:"to promise 'by one's truth.' Men and women were betrothed when they were engaged to be married. This usually took place a year or more before marriage. From the time of betrothal the woman was regarded as the lawful wife of the man to whom she was betrothed (<r>Deut. 28:30; Judg. 14:2, 8; Matt. 1:18-21</r>). The term is figuratively employed of the spiritual connection between God and his people (<r>Hos. 2:19, 20</r>)."},

{i:576,k:"Beyond",t:"when used with reference to Jordan, signifies in the writings of Moses the west side of the river, as he wrote on the east bank (<r>Gen. 50:10, 11; Deut. 1:1, 5; 3:8, 20; 4:46</r>); but in the writings of Joshua, after he had crossed the river, it means the east side (<r>Josh. 5:1; 12:7; 22:7</r>)."},
{i:577,k:"Bezaleel",t:"in the shadow of God; i.e., 'under his protection', the artificer who executed the work of art in connection with the tabernacle in the wilderness (<r>Ex. 31:2; 35:30</r>). He was engaged principally in works of metal, wood, and stone; while Aholiab, who was associated with him and subordinate to him, had the charge of the textile fabrics (36:1, 2; 38:22). He was of the tribe of Judah, the son of Uri, and grandson of Hur (31:2). Mention is made in Ezra 10:30 of another of the same name."},
{i:578,k:"Bezek",t:"lightning. (1.) The residence of Adoni-bezek, in the lot of Judah (<r>Judg. 1:5</r>). It was in the mountains, not far from Jerusalem. Probably the modern Bezkah, 6 miles south-east of Lydda."},

It has been identified with the modern ruined village of Burazin, some 12 miles north of Heshbon; also with Kasur-el-Besheir, 2 miles south-west of Dibon."},
{i:580,k:"Bible",t:"Bible, the English form of the Greek name _Biblia_, meaning 'books,' the name which in the fifth century began to be given to the entire collection of sacred books, the 'Library of Divine Revelation.' The name Bible was adopted by Wickliffe, and came gradually into use in our English language. The Bible consists of sixty-six different books, composed by many different writers, in three different languages, under different circumstances; writers of almost every social rank, statesmen and peasants, kings, herdsmen, fishermen, priests, tax-gatherers, tentmakers; educated and uneducated, Jews and Gentiles; most of them unknown to each other, and writing at various periods during the space of about 1600 years: and yet, after all, it is only one book dealing with only one subject in its numberless aspects and relations, the subject of man's redemption."},
{i:581,k:"Bier",t:"the frame on which dead bodies were conveyed to the grave (<r>Luke 7:14</r>)."},
{i:582,k:"Bigtha",t:"garden, or gift of fortune, one of the seven eunuchs or chamberlains who had charge of the harem of Ahasuerus (<r>Esther 1:10</r>)."},
{i:583,k:"Bigthan",t:"one of the eunuchs who 'kept the door' in the court of Ahasuerus. With Teresh he conspired against the king's life. Mordecai detected the conspiracy, and the culprits were hanged (<r>Esther 2:21-23; 6:1-3</r>)."},
{i:584,k:"Bildad",t:"son of contention, one of Job's friends. He is called 'the Shuhite,' probably as belonging to Shuah, a district in Arabia, in which Shuah, the sixth son of Abraham by Keturah, settled (<r>Gen. 25:2</r>). He took part in each of the three controversies into which Job's friends entered with him (<r>Job 8:1; 18:1; 25:1</r>), and delivered three speeches, very severe and stern in their tone, although less violent than those of Zophar, but more so than those of Eliphaz."},
{i:585,k:"Bilgah",t:"cheerful. (1.) The head of the fifteenth sacerdotal course for the temple service (<r>1 Chr. 24:14</r>). (2.) A priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<r>Neh. 12:5, 18</r>)."},
{i:586,k:"Bilhah",t:"faltering; bashful, Rachel's handmaid, whom she gave to Jacob (<r>Gen. 29:29</r>). She was the mother of Dan and Naphtali (<r>Gen. 30:3-8</r>). Reuben was cursed by his father for committing adultry with her (35:22; 49:4). He was deprived of the birth-right, which was given to the sons of Joseph."},
{i:587,k:"Bilshan",t:"son of the tongue; i.e., 'eloquent', a man of some note who returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel (<r>Ezra 2:2; Neh. 7:7</r>)."},
{i:588,k:"Bird",t:"Birds are divided in the Mosaic law into two classes, (1) the clean (<r>Lev. 1:14-17; 5:7-10; 14:4-7</r>), which were offered in sacrifice; and (2) the unclean (<r>Lev. 11:13-20</r>). When offered in sacrifice, they were not divided as other victims were (<r>Gen. 15:10</r>). They are mentioned also as an article of food (<r>Deut. 14:11</r>). The art of snaring wild birds is referred to (<r>Ps. 124:7; Prov. 1:17; 7:23; Jer. 5:27</r>). Singing birds are mentioned in Ps. 104:12; Eccl. 12:4. Their timidity is alluded to (<r>Hos. 11:11</r>). The reference in Ps. 84:3 to the swallow and the sparrow may be only a comparison equivalent to, 'What her house is to the sparrow, and her nest to the swallow, that thine altars are to my soul.'"},
{i:589,k:"Birsha",t:"son of wickedness, a king of Gomorrah whom Abraham succoured in the invasion of Chedorlaomer (<r>Gen. 14:2</r>)."},
{i:590,k:"Birth",t:"As soon as a child was born it was washed, and rubbed with salt (<r>Ezek. 16:4</r>), and then swathed with bandages (<r>Job 38:9; Luke 2:7, 12</r>). A Hebrew mother remained forty days in seclusion after the birth of a son, and after the birth of a daughter double that number of days. At the close of that period she entered into the tabernacle or temple and offered up a sacrifice of purification (<r>Lev. 12:1-8; Luke 2:22</r>). A son was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, being thereby consecrated to God (<r>Gen. 17:10-12; comp. Rom. 4:11</r>). Seasons of misfortune are likened to the pains of a woman in travail, and seasons of prosperity to the joy that succeeds child-birth (<r>Isa. 13:8; Jer. 4:31; John 16:21, 22</r>). The natural birth is referred to as the emblem of the new birth (<r>John 3:3-8; Gal. 6:15; Titus 3:5, etc.</r>)."},
{i:591,k:"Birth-day",t:"The observance of birth-days was common in early times (<r>Job 1:4, 13, 18</r>). They were specially celebrated in the land of Egypt (<r>Gen. 40:20</r>). There is no recorded instance in Scripture of the celebration of birth-days among the Jews. On the occasion of Herod's birth-day John the Baptist was beheaded (<r>Matt. 14:6</r>)."},
{i:592,k:"Birthright",t:"(1.) This word denotes the special privileges and advantages belonging to the first-born son among the Jews. He became the priest of the family. Thus Reuben was the first-born of the patriarchs, and so the priesthood of the tribes belonged to him. That honour was, however, transferred by God from Reuben to Levi (<r>Num. 3:12, 13; 8:18</r>)."},
{i:593,k:"Bishop",t:"an overseer. In apostolic times, it is quite manifest that there was no difference as to order between bishops and elders or presbyters (<r>Acts 20:17-28; 1 Pet. 5:1, 2; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3</r>). The term bishop is never once used to denote a different office from that of elder or presbyter. These different names are simply titles of the same office, 'bishop' designating the function, namely, that of oversight, and 'presbyter' the dignity appertaining to the office. Christ is figuratively called 'the bishop [episcopos] of souls' (<r>1 Pet. 2:25</r>)."},
{i:594,k:"Bit",t:"the curb put into the mouths of horses to restrain them. The Hebrew word (metheg) so rendered in Ps. 32:9 is elsewhere translated 'bridle' (<r>2 Kings 19:28; Prov. 26:3; Isa. 37:29</r>). Bits were generally made of bronze or iron, but sometimes also of gold or silver. In James 3:3 the Authorized Version translates the Greek word by 'bits,' but the Revised Version by 'bridles.'"},
{i:595,k:"Bith-ron",t:"the broken or divided place, a district in the Arabah or Jordan valley, on the east of the river (<r>2 Sam. 2:29</r>). It was probably the designation of the region in general, which is broken and intersected by ravines."},
{i:596,k:"Bithynia",t:"a province in Asia Minor, to the south of the Euxine and Propontis. Christian congregations were here formed at an early time (<r>1 Pet. 1:1</r>). Paul was prevented by the Spirit from entering this province (<r>Acts 16:7</r>). It is noted in church history as the province ruled over by Pliny as Roman proconsul, who was perplexed as to the course he should take with the numerous Christians brought before his tribunal on account of their profession of Christianity and their conduct, and wrote to Trajan, the emperor, for instructions (A.D. 107)."},
{i:597,k:"Bitter",t:"Bitterness is symbolical of affliction, misery, and servitude (<r>Ex. 1:14; Ruth 1:20; Jer. 9:15</r>). The Chaldeans are called the 'bitter and hasty nation' (<r>Hab. 1:6</r>). The 'gall of bitterness' expresses a state of great wickedness (<r>Acts 8:23</r>). A 'root of bitterness' is a wicked person or a dangerous sin (<r>Heb. 12:15</r>)."},
{i:598,k:"Bittern",t:"is found three times in connection with the desolations to come upon Babylon, Idumea, and Nineveh (<r>Isa. 14:23; 34:11; Zeph. 2:14</r>). This bird belongs to the class of cranes. Its scientific name is Botaurus stellaris. It is a solitary bird, frequenting marshy ground. The Hebrew word (kippod) thus rendered in the Authorized Version is rendered 'porcupine' in the Revised Version. But in the passages noted the kippod is associated with birds, with pools of water, and with solitude and desolation. This favours the idea that not the 'porcupine' but the 'bittern' is really intended by the word."},
{i:599,k:"Bitumen",t:"Gen. 11:3, R.V., margin, rendered in the A.V. 'slime'), a mineral pitch. With this the ark was pitched (6:14. See also Ex. 2:3.) (<see target='x-self'>See SLIME.</see>)"},
{i:600,k:"Black",t:"properly the absence of all colour. In Prov. 7:9 the Hebrew word means, as in the margin of the Revised Version, 'the pupil of the eye.' It is translated 'apple' of the eye in Deut. 32:10; Ps. 17:8; Prov. 7:2. It is a different word which is rendered 'black' in Lev. 13:31,37; Cant. 1:5; 5:11; and Zech. 6:2, 6. It is uncertain what the 'black marble' of Esther 1:6 was which formed a part of the mosaic pavement."},
{i:601,k:"Blade",t:"applied to the glittering point of a spear (<r>Job 39:23</r>) or sword (<r>Nah. 3:3</r>), the blade of a dagger (<r>Judg. 3:22</r>); the 'shoulder blade' (<r>Job 31:22</r>); the 'blade' of cereals (<r>Matt. 13:26</r>)."},
{i:602,k:"Blains",t:"occurs only in connection with the sixth plague of Egypt (<r>Ex. 9:9, 10</r>). In Deut. 28:27, 35, it is called 'the botch of Egypt.' It seems to have been the fearful disease of black leprosy, a kind of elephantiasis, producing burning ulcers."},
{i:603,k:"Blasphemy",t:"In the sense of speaking evil of God this word is found in Ps. 74:18; Isa. 52:5; Rom. 2:24; Rev. 13:1, 6; 16:9, 11, 21. It denotes also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse (<r>1 Kings 21:10; Acts 13:45; 18:6, etc.</r>). Our Lord was accused of blasphemy when he claimed to be the Son of God (<r>Matt. 26:65; comp. Matt. 9:3; Mark 2:7</r>). They who deny his Messiahship blaspheme Jesus (<r>Luke 22:65; John 10:36</r>)."},
{i:604,k:"Blastus",t:"chamberlain to king Herod Agrippa I. (<r>Acts 12:20</r>). Such persons generally had great influence with their masters."},
{i:605,k:"Blemish",t:"imperfection or bodily deformity excluding men from the priesthood, and rendering animals unfit to be offered in sacrifice (<r>Lev. 21:17-23; 22:19-25</r>). The Christian church, as justified in Christ, is 'without blemish' (<r>Eph. 5:27</r>). Christ offered himself a sacrifice 'without blemish,' acceptable to God (<r>1 Pet. 1:19</r>)."},
{i:606,k:"Bless",t:"(1.) God blesses his people when he bestows on them some gift temporal or spiritual (<r>Gen. 1:22; 24:35; Job 42:12; Ps. 45:2; 104:24, 35</r>)."},
{i:607,k:"Blind",t:"Blind beggars are frequently mentioned (<r>Matt. 9:27; 12:22; 20:30; John 5:3</r>). The blind are to be treated with compassion (<r>Lev. 19:14; Deut. 27:18</r>). Blindness was sometimes a punishment for disobedience (<r>1 Sam. 11:2; Jer. 39:7</r>), sometimes the effect of old age (<r>Gen. 27:1; 1 Kings 14:4; 1 Sam. 4:15</r>). Conquerors sometimes blinded their captives (<r>2 Kings 25:7; 1 Sam. 11:2</r>). Blindness denotes ignorance as to spiritual things (<r>Isa. 6:10; 42:18, 19; Matt. 15:14; Eph. 4:18</r>). The opening of the eyes of the blind is peculiar to the Messiah (<r>Isa. 29:18</r>). Elymas was smitten with blindness at Paul's word (<r>Acts 13:11</r>)."},
{i:608,k:"Blood",t:"(1.) As food, prohibited in Gen. 9:4, where the use of animal food is first allowed. Comp. Deut. 12:23; Lev. 3:17; 7:26; 17:10-14. The injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in the decree of the council of Jerusalem (<r>Acts 15:29</r>). It has been held by some, and we think correctly, that this law of prohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while others regard it as still binding on all. Blood was eaten by the Israelites after the battle of Gilboa (<r>1 Sam. 14:32-34</r>)."},

{i:610,k:"Blot",t:"a stain or reproach (<r>Job 31:7; Prov. 9:7</r>). To blot out sin is to forgive it (<r>Ps. 51:1, 9; Isa. 44:22; Acts 3:19</r>). Christ's blotting out the handwriting of ordinances was his fulfilling the law in our behalf (<r>Col. 2:14</r>)."},

The robe of the high priest's ephod was to be all of this colour (<r>Ex. 28:31</r>), also the loops of the curtains (26:4) and the ribbon of the breastplate (28:28). Blue cloths were also made for various sacred purposes (<r>Num. 4:6, 7, 9, 11, 12</r>). (See COLOUR"},

The Hebrews abhorred swine's flesh, and accordingly none of these animals were reared, except in the district beyond the Sea of Galilee. In the psalm quoted above the powers that destroyed the Jewish nation are compared to wild boars and wild beasts of the field."},
{i:614,k:"Boaz",t:"alacrity. (1.) The husband of Ruth, a wealthy Bethlehemite. By the 'levirate law' the duty devolved on him of marrying Ruth the Moabitess (<r>Ruth 4:1-13</r>). He was a kinsman of Mahlon, her first husband."},
{i:615,k:"Bochim",t:"weepers, a place where the angel of the Lord reproved the Israelites for entering into a league with the people of the land. This caused them bitterly to weep, and hence the name of the place (<r>Judg. 2:1, 5</r>). It lay probably at the head of one of the valleys between Gilgal and Shiloh."},

{i:617,k:"Bolled",t:"(<r>Ex. 9:31</r>), meaning 'swollen or podded for seed,' was adopted in the Authorized Version from the version of Coverdale (1535). The Revised Version has in the margin 'was in bloom,' which is the more probable rendering of the Hebrew word. It is the fact that in Egypt when barley is in ear (about February) flax is blossoming."},
{i:618,k:"Bolster",t:"The Hebrew word _kebir_, rendered 'pillow' in 1 Sam. 19:13, 16, but in Revised Version marg. 'quilt' or 'network,' probably means some counterpane or veil intended to protect the head of the sleeper. A different Hebrew word (meraashoth') is used for 'bolster' (<r>1 Sam. 26:7, 11, 16</r>). It is rightly rendered in Revised Version 'at his head.' In Gen. 28:11, 18 the Authorized Version renders it 'for his pillows,' and the Revised Version 'under his head.' In Ezek. 13:18, 20 another Hebrew word (kesathoth) is used, properly denoting 'cushions' or 'pillows,' as so rendered both in the Authorized and the Revised Version."},
{i:619,k:"Bond",t:"an obligation of any kind (<r>Num. 30:2, 4, 12</r>). The word means also oppression or affliction (<r>Ps. 116:16; Phil. 1:7</r>). Christian love is the 'bond of perfectness' (<r>Col. 3:14</r>), and the influences of the Spirit are the 'bond of peace' (<r>Eph. 4:3</r>)."},
{i:620,k:"Bondage",t:"of Israel in Egypt (<r>Ex. 2:23, 25; 5</r>), which is called the 'house of bondage' (13:3; 20:2). This word is used also with reference to the captivity in Babylon (<r>Isa. 14:3</r>), and the oppression of the Persian king (<r>Ezra 9:8, 9</r>)."},
{i:621,k:"Bonnet",t:"(Heb. peer), Ex. 39:28 (R.V., 'head-tires'); Ezek. 44:18 (R.V., 'tires'), denotes properly a turban worn by priests, and in Isa. 3:20 (R.V., 'head-tires') a head-dress or tiara worn by females. The Hebrew word so rendered literally means an ornament, as in Isa. 61:10 (R.V., 'garland'), and in Ezek. 24:17, 23 'tire' (R.V., 'head-tire'). It consisted of a piece of cloth twisted about the head. In Ex. 28:40; 29:9 it is the translation of a different Hebrew word (migba'ah), which denotes the turban (R.V., 'head-tire') of the common priest as distinguished from the mitre of the high priest. (<see target='x-self'>See MITRE.</see>)"},
{i:622,k:"Book",t:"This word has a comprehensive meaning in Scripture. In the Old Testament it is the rendering of the Hebrew word _sepher_, which properly means a 'writing,' and then a 'volume' (<r>Ex. 17:14; Deut. 28:58; 29:20; Job 19:23</r>) or 'roll of a book' (<r>Jer. 36:2, 4</r>)."},
{i:623,k:"Booth",t:"a hut made of the branches of a tree. In such tabernacles Jacob sojourned for a season at a place named from this circumstance Succoth (<r>Gen. 33:17</r>). Booths were erected also at the feast of Tabernacles (q.v.), Lev. 23:42, 43, which commemorated the abode of the Israelites in the wilderness."},
{i:624,k:"Booty",t:"captives or cattle or objects of value taken in war. In Canaan all that breathed were to be destroyed (<r>Deut. 20: 16</r>). The 'pictures and images' of the Canaanites were to be destroyed also (<r>Num. 33:52</r>). The law of booty as to its division is laid down in Num. 31:26-47. David afterwards introduced a regulation that the baggage-guard should share the booty equally with the soldiers engaged in battle. He also devoted of the spoils of war for the temple (<r>1 Sam. 30:24-26; 2 Sam. 8:11; 1 Chr. 26:27</r>)."},
{i:625,k:"Borrow",t:"The Israelites 'borrowed' from the Egyptians (<r>Ex. 12:35, R.V., 'asked'</r>) in accordance with a divine command (3:22; 11:2). But the word (sha'al) so rendered here means simply and always to 'request' or 'demand.' The Hebrew had another word which is properly translated 'borrow' in Deut. 28:12; Ps. 37:21. It was well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so anxious to get the Israelites away out of their land that 'they let them have what they asked' (<r>Ex. 12:36, R.V.</r>), or literally 'made them to ask,' urged them to take whatever they desired and depart. (<see target='x-self'>See LOAN.</see>)"},
{i:626,k:"Bosom",t:"In the East objects are carried in the bosom which Europeans carry in the pocket. To have in one's bosom indicates kindness, secrecy, or intimacy (<r>Gen. 16:5; 2 Sam. 12:8</r>). Christ is said to have been in 'the bosom of the Father,' i.e., he had the most perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with him (<r>John 1:18</r>). John (13:23) was 'leaning on Jesus' bosom' at the last supper. Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a tender, watchful care over them (<r>Isa. 40:11</r>)."},
{i:627,k:"Bosor",t:"the Chaldee or Aramaic form of the name Beor, the father of Balaam (<r>2 Pet. 2:15</r>)."},
{i:628,k:"Bosses",t:"the projecting parts of a shield (<r>Job 15:26</r>). The Hebrew word thus rendered means anything convex or arched, and hence the back, as of animals."},
{i:629,k:"Botch",t:"the name given in Deut. 28:27, 35 to one of the Egyptian plagues (<r>Ex. 9:9</r>). The word so translated is usually rendered 'boil' (q.v.)."},

{i:631,k:"Bow",t:"The bow was in use in early times both in war and in the chase (<r>Gen. 21:20; 27:3; 48:22</r>). The tribe of Benjamin were famous for the use of the bow (<r>1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2; 2 Chr. 14:8; 17:17</r>); so also were the Elamites (<r>Isa. 22:6</r>) and the Lydians (<r>Jer. 46:9</r>). The Hebrew word commonly used for bow means properly to tread (<r>1 Chr. 5:18; 8:40</r>), and hence it is concluded that the foot was employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel (correctly 'copper') are mentioned (<r>2 Sam. 22:35; Ps. 18:34</r>)."},
{i:632,k:"Bowels",t:"(<r>Phil. 1:8; 2:1; Col. 3:12</r>), compassionate feelings; R.V., 'tender mercies.'"},
{i:633,k:"Bowing",t:"a mode of showing respect. Abraham 'bowed himself to the people of the land' (<r>Gen. 23:7</r>); so Jacob to Esau (<r>Gen. 33:3</r>); and the brethren of Joseph before him as the governor of the land (<r>Gen. 43:28</r>). Bowing is also frequently mentioned as an act of adoration to idols (<r>Josh. 23:7; 2 Kings 5:18; Judg. 2:19; Isa. 44:15</r>), and to God (<r>Josh. 5:14; Ps. 22:29; 72:9; Micah 6:6; Ps. 95:6; Eph. 3:14</r>)."},

The reservoir for oil, from which pipes led to each lamp in Zechariah's vision of the candlestick, is called also by this name (<r>Zech. 4:2, 3</r>); so also are the vessels used for libations (<r>Ex. 25:29; 37:16</r>)."},
{i:635,k:"Box",t:"for holding oil or perfumery (<r>Mark 14:3</r>). It was of the form of a flask or bottle. The Hebrew word (pak) used for it is more appropriately rendered 'vial' in 1 Sam. 10:1, and should also be so rendered in 2 Kings 9:1, where alone else it occurs."},
{i:636,k:"Box-tree",t:"(Heb. teashshur), mentioned in Isa. 60:13; 41:19, was, according to some, a species of cedar growing in Lebanon. The words of Ezek. 27:6 literally translated are, 'Thy benches they have made of ivory, the daughter of the ashur tree,' i.e., inlaid with ashur wood. The ashur is the box-tree, and accordingly the Revised Version rightly reads 'inlaid in box wood.' This is the Buxus sempervirens of botanists. It is remarkable for the beauty of its evergreen foliage and for the utility of its hard and durable wood."},
{i:637,k:"Bozrah",t:"enclosure; fortress. (1.) The city of Jobab, one of the early Edomite kings (<r>Gen. 36:33</r>). This place is mentioned by the prophets in later times (<r>Isa. 34:6; Jer. 49:13; Amos 1:12; Micah 2:12</r>). Its modern representative is el-Busseireh. It lies in the mountain district of Petra, 20 miles to the south-east of the Dead Sea."},

{i:639,k:"Bramble",t:"(1.) Hebrew _atad_, Judg. 9:14; rendered 'thorn,' Ps. 58:9. The LXX. and Vulgate render by rhamnus, a thorny shrub common in Palestine, resembling the hawthorn."},

{i:641,k:"Brass",t:"which is an alloy of copper and zinc, was not known till the thirteenth century. What is designated by this word in Scripture is properly copper (<r>Deut. 8:9</r>). It was used for fetters (<r>Judg. 16:21; 2 Kings 25:7</r>), for pieces of armour (<r>1 Sam. 17:5, 6</r>), for musical instruments (<r>1 Chr. 15:19; 1 Cor. 13:1</r>), and for money (<r>Matt. 10:9</r>)."},

{i:649,k:"Bride",t:"frequently used in the ordinary sense (<r>Isa. 49:18; 61:10, etc.</r>). The relation between Christ and his church is set forth under the figure of that between a bridegroom and bride (<r>John 3:29</r>). The church is called 'the bride' (<r>Rev. 21:9; 22:17</r>). Compare parable of the Ten Virgins (<r>Matt. 25:1-13</r>)."},
{i:650,k:"Bridle",t:"Three Hebrew words are thus rendered in the Authorized Version. (1.) Heb. _mahsom'_ signifies a muzzle or halter or bridle, by which the rider governs his horse (<r>Ps.39:1</r>)."},
{i:651,k:"Brier",t:"This word occurs frequently, and is the translation of several different terms. (1.) Micah 7:4, it denotes a species of thorn shrub used for hedges. In Prov. 15:19 the word is rendered 'thorn' (Heb. _hedek_, 'stinging'), supposed by some to be what is called the 'apple of Sodom' (q.v.)."},
{i:652,k:"Brigandine",t:"(<r>Jer. 46:4; 51:3</r>), an obsolete English word denoting a scale coat of armour, or habergeon, worn by light-armed 'brigands.' The Revised Version has 'coat of mail.'"},

The cities of the plain were destroyed by a rain of fire and brimstone (<r>Gen. 19:24, 25</r>). In Isa. 34:9 allusion is made to the destruction of these cities. This word figuratively denotes destruction or punishment (<r>Job 18:15; Isa. 30:33; 34:9; Ps. 11:6; Ezek. 38:22</r>). It is used to express the idea of excruciating torment in Rev. 14:10; 19:20; 20:10."},
{i:654,k:"Brook",t:"a torrent. (1.) Applied to small streams, as the Arnon, Jabbok, etc. Isaiah (15:7) speaks of the 'book of the willows,' probably the Wady-el-Asha. (2.) It is also applied to winter torrents (<r>Job 6:15; Num. 34:5; Josh. 15:4, 47</r>), and to the torrent-bed or wady as well as to the torrent itself (<r>Num. 13:23; 1 Kings 17:3</r>). (3.) In Isa. 19:7 the river Nile is meant, as rendered in the Revised Version."},

They probably adopted the kind of architecture for their dwellings which they found already existing when they entered Canaan (<r>Deut. 6:10; Num. 13:19</r>). Phoenician artists (<r>2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Kings 5:6, 18</r>) assisted at the erection of the royal palace and the temple at Jerusalem. Foreigners also assisted at the restoration of the temple after the Exile (<r>Ezra 3:7</r>)."},

{i:662,k:"Bulrush",t:"(1.) In Isa. 58:5 the rendering of a word which denotes 'belonging to a marsh,' from the nature of the soil in which it grows (<r>Isa. 18:2</r>). It was sometimes platted into ropes (<r>Job. 41:2; A.V., 'hook,' R.V., 'rope,' lit. 'cord of rushes'</r>)."},

{i:666,k:"Burial",t:"The first burial we have an account of is that of Sarah (Gen. 23). The first commercial transaction recorded is that of the purchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron 'four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchants.' Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of the land of Canaan, the only part he ever possessed. When he himself died, 'his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,' beside Sarah his wife (<r>Gen. 25:9</r>)."},
{i:667,k:"Burnt offering",t:"Hebrew _olah_; i.e., 'ascending,' the whole being consumed by fire, and regarded as ascending to God while being consumed. Part of every offering was burnt in the sacred fire, but this was wholly burnt, a 'whole burnt offering.' It was the most frequent form of sacrifice, and apparently the only one mentioned in the book of Genesis. Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel (<r>Gen. 4:3, 4, here called _minhah_; i.e., 'a gift'</r>), Noah (<r>Gen. 8:20</r>), Abraham (<r>Gen. 22:2, 7, 8, 13</r>), and by the Hebrews in Egypt (<r>Ex. 10:25</r>)."},

{i:669,k:"Butler",t:"properly a servant in charge of the wine (<r>Gen. 40:1-13; 41:9</r>). The Hebrew word, _mashkeh_, thus translated is rendered also (plural) 'cup-bearers' (<r>1 Kings 10:5; 2 Chr. 9:4</r>). Nehemiah (1:11) was cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes.

In the New Testament this title is given to various emperors as sovereigns of Judaea without their accompanying distinctive proper names (<r>John 19:15; Acts 17:7</r>). The Jews paid tribute to Caesar (<r>Matt. 22:17</r>), and all Roman citizens had the right of appeal to him (<r>Acts 25:11</r>). The Caesars referred to in the New Testament are Augustus (<r>Luke 2:1</r>), Tiberius (3:1; 20:22), Claudius (<r>Acts 11:28</r>), and Nero (<r>Acts 25:8; Phil. 4:22</r>)."},

It is mentioned in Matt. 16:13 and Mark 8:27 as the northern limit of our Lord's public ministry. According to some its original name was Baal-Gad (<r>Josh. 11:17</r>), or Baal-Hermon (<r>Judg. 3:3; 1 Chr. 5:23</r>), when it was a Canaanite sanctuary of Baal. It was afterwards called Panium or Paneas, from a deep cavern full of water near the town. This name was given to the cavern by the Greeks of the Macedonian kingdom of Antioch because of its likeness to the grottos of Greece, which were always associated with the worship of their god Pan. Its modern name is Banias. Here Herod built a temple, which he dedicated to Augustus Caesar. This town was afterwards enlarged and embellished by Herod Philip, the tetrarch of Trachonitis, of whose territory it formed a part, and was called by him Caesarea Philippi, partly after his own name, and partly after that of the emperor Tiberius Caesar. It is thus distinguished from the Caesarea of Palestine. (<see target='x-self'>See JORDAN.</see>)"},
{i:682,k:"Caesarea",t:"(Palestinae), a city on the shore of the Mediterranean, on the great road from Tyre to Egypt, about 70 miles northwest of Jerusalem, at the northern extremity of the plain of Sharon. It was built by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it after Caesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos = 'Augustus'), on the site of an old town called 'Strato's Tower.' It was the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors or procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildings of great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted through the instrumentality of Peter (<r>Acts 10:1, 24</r>), and thus for the first time the door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided here with his four daughters (21:8). From this place Saul sailed for his native Tarsus when forced to flee from Jerusalem (9:30), and here he landed when returning from his second missionary journey (18:22). He remained as a prisoner here for two years before his voyage to Rome (<r>Acts 24:27; 25:1, 4, 6, 13</r>). Here on a 'set day,' when games were celebrated in the theatre in honour of the emperor Claudius, Herod Agrippa I. appeared among the people in great pomp, and in the midst of the idolatrous homage paid to him was suddenly smitten by an angel, and carried out a dying man. He was 'eaten of worms' (12:19-23), thus perishing by the same loathsome disease as his granfather, Herod the Great. It still retains its ancient name Kaiseriyeh, but is now desolate. 'The present inhabitants of the ruins are snakes, scorpions, lizards, wild boars, and jackals.' It is described as the most desolate city of all Palestine."},

He held this office during the whole of Pilate's administration. His wife was the daughter of Annas, who had formerly been high priest, and was probably the vicar or deputy (Heb. sagan) of Caiaphas. He was of the sect of the Sadducees (<r>Acts 5:17</r>), and was a member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death 'for the people, and that the whole nation perish not' (<r>John 11:50</r>). In these words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. 'Like Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself.' Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the sentence against him (<r>Matt. 27:2; John 18:28</r>). At a later period his hostility to the gospel is still manifest (<r>Acts 4:6</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See ANNAS.</see>)"},
{i:685,k:"Cain",t:"a possession; a spear. (1.) The first-born son of Adam and Eve (Gen. 4). He became a tiller of the ground, as his brother Abel followed the pursuits of pastoral life. He was 'a sullen, self-willed, haughty, vindictive man; wanting the religious element in his character, and defiant even in his attitude towards God.' It came to pass 'in process of time' (marg. 'at the end of days'), i.e., probably on the Sabbath, that the two brothers presented their offerings to the Lord. Abel's offering was of the 'firstlings of his flock and of the fat,' while Cain's was 'of the fruit of the ground.' Abel's sacrifice was 'more excellent' (<r>Heb. 11:4</r>) than Cain's, and was accepted by God. On this account Cain was 'very wroth,' and cherished feelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was at length guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to death (<r>1 John 3:12</r>). For this crime he was expelled from Eden, and henceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon him some mark which God had set upon him in answer to his own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected from the wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign to assure him that he would not be slain (<r>Gen. 4:15</r>). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth, he went forth into the 'land of Nod', i.e., the land of 'exile', which is said to have been in the 'east of Eden,' and there he built a city, the first we read of, and called it after his son's name, Enoch. His descendants are enumerated to the sixth generation. They gradually degenerated in their moral and spiritual condition till they became wholly corrupt before God. This corruption prevailed, and at length the Deluge was sent by God to prevent the final triumph of evil. (<see target='x-self'>See ABEL.</see>)"},
{i:686,k:"Cainan",t:"possession; smith. (1.) The fourth antediluvian patriarch, the eldest son of Enos. He was 70 years old at the birth of his eldest son Mahalaleel, after which he lived 840 years (<r>Gen. 5:9-14</r>), and was 910 years old when he died. He is also called Kenan (<r>1 Chr. 1:2</r>)."},
{i:687,k:"Cake",t:"Cakes made of wheat or barley were offered in the temple. They were salted, but unleavened (<r>Ex. 29:2; Lev. 2:4</r>). In idolatrous worship thin cakes or wafers were offered 'to the queen of heaven' (<r>Jer. 7:18; 44:19</r>)."},
{i:688,k:"Calah",t:"one of the most ancient cities of Assyria. 'Out of that land he [i.e., Nimrod] went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, and Resen' (<r>Gen. 10:11, R.V.</r>). Its site is now marked probably by the Nimrud ruins on the left bank of the Tigris. These cover an area of about 1,000 acres, and are second only in size and importance to the mass of ruins opposite Mosul. This city was at one time the capital of the empire, and was the residence of Sardanapalus and his successors down to the time of Sargon, who built a new capital, the modern Khorsabad. It has been conjectured that these four cities mentioned in Gen. 10:11 were afterwards all united into one and called Nineveh (q.v.)."},
{i:689,k:"Calamus",t:"the Latin for cane, Hebrew _Kaneh_, mentioned (<r>Ex. 30:23</r>) as one of the ingredients in the holy anointing oil, one of the sweet scents (<r>Cant. 4:14</r>), and among the articles sold in the markets of Tyre (<r>Ezek. 27:19</r>). The word designates an Oriental plant called the 'sweet flag,' the Acorus calamus of Linnaeus. It is elsewhere called 'sweet cane' (<r>Isa. 43:24; Jer. 6:20</r>). It has an aromatic smell, and when its knotted stalk is cut and dried and reduced to powder, it forms an ingredient in the most precious perfumes. It was not a native of Palestine, but was imported from Arabia Felix or from India. It was probably that which is now known in India by the name of 'lemon grass' or 'ginger grass,' the Andropogon schoenanthus. (<see target='x-self'>See CANE.</see>)"},
{i:690,k:"Calcol",t:"(<r>1 Chr. 2:6</r>), sustenance, the same probably as Chalcol (<r>1 Kings 4:31</r>), one of the four sages whom Solomon excelled in wisdom; for 'he was wiser than all men.'"},
{i:691,k:"Caleb",t:"a dog. (1.) One of the three sons of Hezron of the tribe of Judah. He is also called Chelubai (<r>1 Chr. 2:9</r>). His descendants are enumerated (18-20, 42-49)."},
{i:692,k:"Calf",t:"Calves were commonly made use of in sacrifices, and are therefore frequently mentioned in Scripture. The 'fatted calf' was regarded as the choicest of animal food; it was frequently also offered as a special sacrifice (<r>1 Sam. 28:24; Amos 6:4; Luke 15:23</r>). The words used in Jer. 34:18, 19, 'cut the calf in twain,' allude to the custom of dividing a sacrifice into two parts, between which the parties ratifying a covenant passed (<r>Gen. 15:9, 10, 17, 18</r>). The sacrifice of the lips, i.e., priase, is called 'the calves of our lips' (<r>Hos. 14:2, R.V., 'as bullocks the offering of our lips.' Comp. Heb. 13:15; Ps. 116:7; Jer. 33:11</r>)."},
{i:693,k:"Calkers",t:"workmen skilled in stopping the seams of the deck or sides of vessels. The inhabitants of Gebel were employed in such work on Tyrian vessels (<r>Ezek. 27:9, 27; marg., 'strengtheners' or 'stoppers of chinks'</r>)."},
{i:694,k:"Call",t:"(1.) To cry for help, hence to pray (<r>Gen. 4:26</r>). Thus men are said to 'call upon the name of the Lord' (<r>Acts 2:21; 7:59; 9:14; Rom. 10:12; 1 Cor. 1:2</r>)."},
{i:695,k:"Calling",t:"a profession, or as we usually say, a vocation (<r>1 Cor. 7:20</r>). The 'hope of your calling' in Eph. 4:4 is the hope resulting from your being called into the kingdom of God."},
{i:696,k:"Calneh",t:"fort, one of the four cities founded by Nimrod (<r>Gen. 10:10</r>). It is the modern Niffer, a lofty mound of earth and rubbish situated in the marshes on the left, i.e., the east, bank of the Euphrates, but 30 miles distant from its present course, and about 60 miles south-south-east from Babylon. It is mentioned as one of the towns with which Tyre carried on trade. It was finally taken and probably destroyed by one of the Assyrian kings (<r>Amos 6:2</r>). It is called Calno (<r>Isa. 10:9</r>) and Canneh (<r>Ezek. 27:23</r>)."},
{i:697,k:"Calvary",t:"only in Luke 23:33, the Latin name Calvaria, which was used as a translation of the Greek word _Kranion_, by which the Hebrew word _Gulgoleth_ was interpreted, 'the place of a skull.' It probably took this name from its shape, being a hillock or low, rounded, bare elevation somewhat in the form of a human skull. It is nowhere in Scripture called a 'hill.' The crucifixion of our Lord took place outside the city walls (<r>Heb. 13:11-13</r>) and near the public thoroughfare. 'This thing was not done in a corner.' (<see target='x-self'>See GOLGOTHA.</see>)"},
{i:698,k:"Camel",t:"from the Hebrew _gamal_, 'to repay' or 'requite,' as the camel does the care of its master. There are two distinct species of camels, having, however, the common characteristics of being 'ruminants without horns, without muzzle, with nostrils forming oblique slits, the upper lip divided and separately movable and extensile, the soles of the feet horny, with two toes covered by claws, the limbs long, the abdomen drawn up, while the neck, long and slender, is bent up and down, the reverse of that of a horse, which is arched.'"},
{i:699,k:"Channel",t:"(1.) The bed of the sea or of a river (<r>Ps. 18:15; Isa. 8:7</r>)."},
{i:700,k:"Chapel",t:"a holy place or sanctuary, occurs only in Amos 7:13, where one of the idol priests calls Bethel 'the king's chapel.'"},
{i:701,k:"Chapiter",t:"the ornamental head or capital of a pillar. Three Hebrew words are so rendered. (1.) _Cothereth_ (<r>1 Kings 7:16; 2 Kings 25:17; 2 Chr. 4:12</r>), meaning a 'diadem' or 'crown.' (2.) _Tzepheth_ (<r>2 Chr. 3:15</r>). (3.) _Rosh_ (<r>Ex. 36:38; 38:17, 19, 28</r>), properly a 'head' or 'top.'"},
{i:702,k:"Chapter",t:"The several books of the Old and New Testaments were from an early time divided into chapters. The Pentateuch was divided by the ancient Hebrews into 54 _parshioth_ or sections, one of which was read in the synagogue every Sabbath day (<r>Acts. 13:15</r>). These sections were afterwards divided into 669 _sidrim_ or orders of unequal length. The Prophets were divided in somewhat the same manner into _haphtaroth_ or passages."},
{i:703,k:"Charashim",t:"craftsmen, a valley named in 1 Chr. 4:14. In Neh. 11:35 the Hebrew word is rendered 'valley of craftsmen' (R.V. marg., Geha-rashim). Nothing is known of it."},
{i:704,k:"Charger",t:"a bowl or deep dish. The silver vessels given by the heads of the tribes for the services of the tabernacle are so named (<r>Num. 7:13, etc.</r>). The 'charger' in which the Baptist's head was presented was a platter or flat wooden trencher (<r>Matt. 14:8, 11; Mark 6:25, 28</r>). The chargers of gold and silver of Ezra 1:9 were probably basins for receiving the blood of sacrifices."},
{i:705,k:"Chariot",t:"a vehicle generally used for warlike purposes. Sometimes, though but rarely, it is spoken of as used for peaceful purposes."},
{i:706,k:"Charity",t:"(1 Cor. 13), the rendering in the Authorized Version of the word which properly denotes love, and is frequently so rendered (always so in the Revised Version). It is spoken of as the greatest of the three Christian graces (<r>1 Cor. 12:31-13:13</r>)."},
{i:707,k:"Charmer",t:"one who practises serpent-charming (<r>Ps. 58:5; Jer. 8:17; Eccl. 10:11</r>). It was an early and universal opinion that the most venomous reptiles could be made harmless by certain charms or by sweet sounds. It is well known that there are jugglers in India and in other Eastern lands who practise this art at the present day."},
{i:708,k:"Charran",t:"another form (<r>Acts 7:2, 4</r>) of Haran (q.v.)."},
{i:709,k:"Chebar",t:"length, a river in the 'land of the Chaldeans' (<r>Ezek. 1:3</r>), on the banks of which were located some of the Jews of the Captivity (<r>Ezek. 1:1; 3:15, 23; 10:15, 20, 22</r>). It has been supposed to be identical with the river Habor, the Chaboras, or modern Khabour, which falls into the Euphrates at Circesium. To the banks of this river some of the Israelites were removed by the Assyrians (<r>2 Kings 17:6</r>). An opinion that has much to support it is that the 'Chebar' was the royal canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the Nahr Malcha, the greatest in Mesopotamia, which connected the Tigris with the Euphrates, in the excavation of which the Jewish captives were probably employed."},
{i:710,k:"Chedorlaomer",t:"(= Khudur-Lagamar of the inscriptions), king of Elam. Many centuries before the age of Abraham, Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula had been conquered by Babylonian kings, and in the time of Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a dynasty which claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings of the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at once South Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the dynasty was Khammu-rabi, who united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon its capital. When he ascended the throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of Babylon (the Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the Biblical Ellasar). The king of Larsa was Eri-Aku ('the servant of the moon-god'), the son of an Elamite prince, Kudur-Mabug, who is entitled 'the father of the land of the Amorites.' A recently discovered tablet enumerates among the enemies of Khammu-rabi, Kudur-Lagamar ('the servant of the goddess Lagamar') or Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and Tudkhula or Tidal. Khammu-rabi, whose name is also read Ammi-rapaltu or Amraphel by some scholars, succeeded in overcoming Eri-Aku and driving the Elamites out of Babylonia. Assur-bani-pal, the last of the Assyrian conquerors, mentions in two inscriptions that he took Susa 1635 years after Kedor-nakhunta, king of Elam, had conquered Babylonia. It was in the year B.C. 660 that Assur-bani-pal took Susa."},
{i:711,k:"Cheek",t:"Smiting on the cheek was accounted a grievous injury and insult (<r>Job 16:10; Lam. 3:30; Micah 5:1</r>). The admonition (<r>Luke 6:29</r>), 'Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other,' means simply, 'Resist not evil' (<r>Matt. 5:39; 1 Pet. 2:19-23</r>). Ps. 3:7 = that God had deprived his enemies of the power of doing him injury."},
{i:712,k:"Cheese",t:"(A.S. cese). This word occurs three times in the Authorized Version as the translation of three different Hebrew words: (1.) 1 Sam. 17:18, 'ten cheeses;' i.e., ten sections of curd. (2.) 2 Sam. 17:29, 'cheese of kine' = perhaps curdled milk of kine. The Vulgate version reads 'fat calves.' (3.) Job 10:10, curdled milk is meant by the word."},
{i:713,k:"Chemarim",t:"black, (<r>Zeph. 1:4; rendered 'idolatrous priests' in 2 Kings 23:5, and 'priests' in Hos. 10:5</r>). Some derive this word from the Assyrian Kamaru, meaning 'to throw down,' and interpret it as describing the idolatrous priests who prostrate themselves before the idols. Others regard it as meaning 'those who go about in black,' or 'ascetics.'"},
{i:714,k:"Chemosh",t:"the destroyer, subduer, or fish-god, the god of the Moabites (<r>Num. 21:29; Jer. 48:7, 13, 46</r>). The worship of this god, 'the abomination of Moab,' was introduced at Jerusalem by Solomon (<r>1 Kings 11:7</r>), but was abolished by Josiah (<r>2 Kings 23:13</r>). On the 'Moabite Stone' (q.v.), Mesha (<r>2 Kings 3:5</r>) ascribes his victories over the king of Israel to this god, 'And Chemosh drove him before my sight.'"},
{i:715,k:"Chenaanah",t:"merchant. (1.) A Benjamite (<r>1 Chr. 7:10</r>). (2.) The father of Zedekiah (<r>1 Kings 22:11, 24</r>)."},
{i:716,k:"Chenaiah",t:"whom Jehovah hath made. 'Chief of the Levites,' probably a Kohathite (<r>1 Chr. 15:22</r>), and therefore not the same as mentioned in 26:29."},
{i:717,k:"Chephirah",t:"village, one of the four cities of the Gibeonitish Hivites with whom Joshua made a league (9:17). It belonged to Benjamin. It has been identified with the modern Kefireh, on the west confines of Benjamin, about 2 miles west of Ajalon and 11 from Jerusalem."},
{i:718,k:"Cherethim",t:"(<r>Ezek. 25:16</r>), more frequently Cherethites, the inhabitants of Southern Philistia, the Philistines (<r>Zeph. 2:5</r>). The Cherethites and the Pelethites were David's life-guards (<r>1 Sam. 30:14; 2 Sam. 8:18; 20:7, 23; 23:23</r>). This name is by some interpreted as meaning 'Cretans,' and by others 'executioners,' who were ready to execute the king's sentence of death (<r>Gen. 37:36, marg.; 1 Kings 2:25</r>)."},
{i:719,k:"Cherith",t:"a cutting; separation; a gorge, a torrent-bed or winter-stream, a 'brook,' in whose banks the prophet Elijah hid himself during the early part of the three years' drought (<r>1 Kings 17:3, 5</r>). It has by some been identified as the Wady el-Kelt behind Jericho, which is formed by the junction of many streams flowing from the mountains west of Jericho. It is dry in summer. Travellers have described it as one of the wildest ravines of this wild region, and peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. But if the prophet's interview with Ahab was in Samaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it is probable that he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some of the ravines of Gilead. The 'brook' is said to have been 'before Jordan,' which probably means that it opened toward that river, into which it flowed. This description would apply to the east as well as to the west of Jordan. Thus Elijah's hiding-place may have been the Jermuk, in the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh."},
{i:720,k:"Cherub",t:"plural cherubim, the name of certain symbolical figures frequently mentioned in Scripture. They are first mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our first parents from Eden (<r>Gen. 3:24</r>). There is no intimation given of their shape or form. They are next mentioned when Moses was commanded to provide furniture for the tabernacle (<r>Ex. 25:17-20; 26:1, 31</r>). God promised to commune with Moses 'from between the cherubim' (25:22). This expression was afterwards used to denote the Divine abode and presence (<r>Num. 7:89; 1 Sam. 4:4; Isa. 37:16; Ps. 80:1; 99:1</r>). In Ezekiel's vision (10:1-20) they appear as living creatures supporting the throne of God. From Ezekiel's description of them (1;10; 41:18, 19), they appear to have been compound figures, unlike any real object in nature; artificial images possessing the features and properties of several animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark; two of colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon's temple. Ezekiel (1:4-14) speaks of four; and this number of 'living creatures' is mentioned in Rev. 4:6. Those on the ark are called the 'cherubim of glory' (<r>Heb. 9:5</r>), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, for on them the visible glory of God rested. They were placed one at each end of the mercy-seat, with wings stretched upward, and their faces 'toward each other and toward the mercy-seat.' They were anointed with holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred furniture."},
{i:721,k:"Chesalon",t:"strength; confidence, a place on the border of Judah, on the side of Mount Jearim (<r>Josh. 15:10</r>); probably identified with the modern village of Kesla, on the western mountains of Judah."},

In Gen. 50:26 it is rendered 'coffin.' In Ezek. 27:24 a different Hebrew word, _genazim_ (plur.), is used. It there means 'treasure-chests.'"},
{i:725,k:"Chestnut tree",t:"(Heb. _'armon_; i.e., 'naked'), mentioned in connection with Jacob's artifice regarding the cattle (<r>Gen. 30:37</r>). It is one of the trees of which, because of its strength and beauty, the Assyrian empire is likened (<r>Ezek. 31:8; R.V., 'plane trees'</r>). It is probably the Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) that is intended. It is a characteristic of this tree that it annually sheds its outer bark, becomes 'naked.' The chestnut tree proper is not a native of Palestine."},
{i:726,k:"Chesulloth",t:"fertile places; the loins, a town of Issachar, on the slopes of some mountain between Jezreel and Shunem (<r>Josh. 19:18</r>). It has been identified with Chisloth-tabor, 2 1/2 miles to the west of Mount Tabor, and north of Jezreel; now Iksal."},
{i:727,k:"Chezib",t:"deceitful, a town where Shelah, the son of Judah, was born (<r>Gen. 38:5</r>). Probably the same as Achzib (q.v.)."},
{i:728,k:"Chidon",t:"dart, the name of the threshing-floor at which the death of Uzzah took place (<r>1 Chr. 13:9</r>). In the parallel passage in Samuel (<r>2 Sam. 6:6</r>) it is called 'Nachon's threshing-floor.' It was a place not far north-west from Jerusalem."},
{i:729,k:"Chief of the three",t:"a title given to Adino the Eznite, one of David's greatest heroes (<r>2 Sam. 23:8</r>); also called Jashobeam (<r>1 Chr. 11:11</r>)."},

{i:731,k:"Chiefs of Asia",t:"'Asiarchs,' the title given to certain wealthy persons annually appointed to preside over the religious festivals and games in the various cities of proconsular Asia (<r>Acts 19:31</r>). Some of these officials appear to have been Paul's friends."},
{i:732,k:"Child",t:"This word has considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably about sixteen years of age (<r>Gen. 37:3</r>); and Benjamin is so called when he was above thirty years (44:20). Solomon called himself a little child when he came to the kingdom (<r>1 Kings 3:7</r>)."},
{i:733,k:"Chileab",t:"protected by the father, David's second son by Abigail (<r>2 Sam. 3:3</r>); called also Daniel (<r>1 Chr. 3:1</r>). He seems to have died when young."},

{i:736,k:"Chimham",t:"pining, probably the youngest son of Barzillai the Gileadite (<r>2 Sam. 19:37-40</r>). The 'habitation of Chimham' (<r>Jer. 41:17</r>) was probably an inn or khan, which is the proper meaning of the Hebrew _geruth_, rendered 'habitation', established in later times in his possession at Bethlehem, which David gave to him as a reward for his loyalty in accompanying him to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom (<r>1 Kings 2:7</r>). It has been supposed that, considering the stationary character of Eastern institutions, it was in the stable of this inn or caravanserai that our Saviour was born (<r>Luke 2:7</r>)."},
{i:737,k:"Chinnereth",t:"lyre, the singular form of the word (<r>Deut. 3:17; Josh. 19:35</r>), which is also used in the plural form, Chinneroth, the name of a fenced city which stood near the shore of the lake of Galilee, a little to the south of Tiberias. The town seems to have given its name to a district, as appears from 1 Kings 15:20, where the plural form of the word is used."},
{i:738,k:"Chios",t:"mentioned in Acts 20:15, an island in the Aegean Sea, about 5 miles distant from the mainland, having a roadstead, in the shelter of which Paul and his companions anchored for a night when on his third missionary return journey. It is now called Scio."},

{i:740,k:"Chittim",t:"or Kittim, a plural form (<r>Gen. 10:4</r>), the name of a branch of the descendants of Javan, the 'son' of Japheth. Balaam foretold (<r>Num. 24:24</r>) 'that ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and afflict Eber.' Daniel prophesied (11:30) that the ships of Chittim would come against the king of the north. It probably denotes Cyprus, whose ancient capital was called Kition by the Greeks."},

The LXX. translated the word by Rhephan, which became corrupted into Remphan, as used by Stephen (<r>Acts 7:43; but R.V., 'Rephan'</r>). Probably the planet Saturn is intended by the name. Astrologers represented this planet as baleful in its influences, and hence the Phoenicians offered to it human sacrifices, especially children."},

Christ is the 'chosen' of God (<r>Isa. 42:1</r>); and the apostles are 'chosen' for their work (<r>Acts 10:41</r>).

It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ (<r>Acts 17:3; 18:5; Matt. 22:42</r>), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by Isaiah (61:1), and by Daniel (9:24-26), who styles him 'Messiah the Prince.'"},
{i:748,k:"Christian",t:"the name given by the Greeks or Romans, probably in reproach, to the followers of Jesus. It was first used at Antioch. The names by which the disciples were known among themselves were 'brethren,' 'the faithful,' 'elect,' 'saints,' 'believers.' But as distinguishing them from the multitude without, the name 'Christian' came into use, and was universally accepted. This name occurs but three times in the New Testament (<r>Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Pet. 4:16</r>)."},

We learn from the Tell-el-Amarna tablets that Palestine had been invaded by the forces of Aram-naharaim (A.V., 'Mesopotamia') more than once, long before the Exodus, and that at the time they were written the king of Aram-naharaim was still intriguing in Canaan. It is mentioned among the countries which took part in the attack upon Egypt in the reign of Rameses III. (of the Twentieth Dynasty), but as its king is not one of the princes stated to have been conquered by the Pharaoh, it would seem that he did not actually enter Egypt. As the reign of Rameses III. corresponds with the Israelitish occupation of Canaan, it is probable that the Egyptian monuments refer to the oppression of the Israelites by Chushan-rishathaim. Canaan was still regarded as a province of Egypt, so that, in attacking it Chushan-rishathaim would have been considered to be attacking Egypt."},
{i:760,k:"Camon",t:"full of stalks, a place (<r>Judg. 10:5</r>) where Jair was buried. It has usually been supposed to have been a city of Gilead, on the east of Jordan. It is probably, however, the modern Tell-el-Kaimun, on the southern slopes of Carmel, the Jokneam of Carmel (<r>Josh. 12:22; 1 Kings 4:12</r>), since it is not at all unlikely that after he became judge, Jair might find it more convenient to live on the west side of Jordan; and that he was buried where he had lived."},

From its leaves is made the peculiar auburn dye with which Eastern women stain their nails and the palms of their hands. It is found only at Engedi, on the shore of the Dead Sea. It is known to botanists by the name Lawsonia alba or inermis, a kind of privet, which grows 6 or 8 feet high. The margin of the Authorized Version of the passages above referred to has 'or cypress,' not with reference to the conifer so called, but to the circumstance that one of the most highly appreciated species of this plant grew in the island of Cyprus."},

It is also mentioned as the birth-place of Nathanael (21:2). It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It has been identified with the modern Kana el-Jelil, also called Khurbet Kana, a place 8 or 9 miles north of Nazareth. Others have identified it with Kefr Kenna, which lies on the direct road to the Sea of Galilee, about 5 miles north-east of Nazareth, and 12 in a direct course from Tiberias.

{i:765,k:"Canaan, the language of",t:"mentioned in Isa. 19:18, denotes the language spoken by the Jews resident in Palestine. The language of the Canaanites and of the Hebrews was substantially the same. This is seen from the fragments of the Phoenician language which still survive, which show the closest analogy to the Hebrew. Yet the subject of the language of the 'Canaanites' is very obscure. The cuneiform writing of Babylon, as well as the Babylonian language, was taught in the Canaanitish schools, and the clay tablets of Babylonian literature were stored in the Canaanitish libraries. Even the Babylonian divinities were borrowed by the Canaanites."},
{i:766,k:"Canaanite",t:"a name given to the apostle Simon (<r>Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18</r>). The word here does not, however, mean a descendant of Canaan, but is a translation, or rather almost a transliteration, of the Syriac word Kanenyeh (R.V. rendered 'Cananaen'), which designates the Jewish sect of the Zealots.

This group was very numerous, and broken up into a great many peoples, as we can judge from the list of nations (Gen. 10), the 'sons of Canaan.'' Six different tribes are mentioned in Ex. 3:8, 17; 23:23; 33:2; 34:11. In Ex. 13:5 the 'Perizzites' are omitted. The 'Girgashites' are mentioned in addition to the foregoing in Deut. 7:1; Josh. 3:10."},
{i:768,k:"Candace",t:"the queen of the Ethiopians whose 'eunuch' or chamberlain was converted to Christianity by the instrumentality of Philip the evangelist (<r>Acts 8:27</r>).

The Hebrew word denotes properly any kind of candle or lamp or torch. It is used as a figure of conscience (<r>Prov. 20:27</r>), of a Christian example (<r>Matt. 5:14, 15</r>), and of prosperity (<r>Job 21:17; Prov. 13:9</r>)."},

Its form is described in Ex. 25:31-40; 37:17-24, and may be seen represented on the Arch of Titus at Rome. It was among the spoils taken by the Romans from the temple of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). It was made of fine gold, and with the utensils belonging to it was a talent in weight."},
{i:771,k:"Cane",t:"a tall sedgy plant with a hollow stem, growing in moist places. In Isa. 43:24; Jer. 6:20, the Hebrew word _kaneh_ is thus rendered, giving its name to the plant. It is rendered 'reed' in 1 Kings 14:15; Job 40:21; Isa. 19:6; 35:7. In Ps. 68:30 the expression 'company of spearmen' is in the margin and the Revised Version 'beasts of the reeds,' referring probably to the crocodile or the hippopotamus as a symbol of Egypt. In 2 Kings 18:21; Isa. 36:6; Ezek. 29:6, 7, the reference is to the weak, fragile nature of the reed. (<see target='x-self'>See CALAMUS.</see>)"},
{i:772,k:"Canker",t:"a gangrene or mortification which gradually spreads over the whole body (<r>2 Tim. 2:17</r>). In James 5:3 'cankered' means 'rusted' (R.V.) or tarnished."},

{i:775,k:"Canon",t:"This word is derived from a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a reed or cane. Hence it means something straight, or something to keep straight; and hence also a rule, or something ruled or measured. It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote that they contained the authoritative rule of faith and practice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to be of canonical authority when it has a right to take a place with the other books which contain a revelation of the Divine will. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiastical authority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship of the book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Old and New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, of faith and practice. They contain the whole supernatural revelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formed gradually under divine guidance. The different books as they were written came into the possession of the Christian associations which began to be formed soon after the day of Pentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all the books were gathered together into one collection containing the whole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books. Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the second century this New Testament collection was substantially such as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved to have, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus the whole is of divine authority."},
{i:776,k:"Capernaum",t:"Nahum's town, a Galilean city frequently mentioned in the history of our Lord. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our Lord's expulsion from Nazareth (<r>Matt. 4:13-16; Luke 4:16-31</r>), Capernaum became his 'own city.' It was the scene of many acts and incidents of his life (<r>Matt. 8:5, 14, 15; 9:2-6, 10-17; 15:1-20; Mark 1:32-34, etc.</r>). The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of judgement (<r>Matt. 11:23</r>)."},
{i:777,k:"Caphtor",t:"a chaplet, the original seat of the Philistines (<r>Deut. 2:23; Jer. 47:4; Amos 9:7</r>). The name is found written in hieroglyphics in the temple of Kom Ombos in Upper Egypt. But the exact situation of Caphtor is unknown, though it is supposed to be Crete, since the Philistines seem to be meant by the 'Cherethites' in 1 Sam. 30:14 (<see target='x-self'>see also 2 Sam. 8:18</see>). It may, however, have been a part of Egypt, the Caphtur in the north Delta, since the Caphtorim were of the same race as the Mizraite people (<r>Gen. 10:14; 1 Chr. 1:12</r>)."},

This same Hebrew word denotes a military captain (<r>Ex. 18:21; 2 Kings 1:9; Deut. 1:15; 1 Sam. 18:13, etc.</r>), the 'captain of the body-guard' (<r>Gen. 37:36; 39:1; 41:10; Jer. 40:1</r>), or, as the word may be rendered, 'chief of the executioners' (marg.). The officers of the king's body-guard frequently acted as executioners. Nebuzar-adan (<r>Jer. 39:13</r>) and Arioch (<r>Dan. 2:14</r>) held this office in Babylon."},

When a city was taken by assault, all the men were slain, and the women and children carried away captive and sold as slaves (Isa. 20; 47:3; 2 Chr. 28:9-15; Ps. 44:12; Joel 3:3), and exposed to the most cruel treatment (<r>Nah. 3:10; Zech. 14:2; Esther 3:13; 2 Kings 8:12; Isa. 13:16, 18</r>).

Pul (q.v.) imposed a tribute on Menahem of a thousand talents of silver (<r>2 Kings 15:19, 20; 1 Chr. 5:26</r>) (B.C. 762), and Tiglath-pileser, in the days of Pekah (B.C. 738), carried away the trans-Jordanic tribes and the inhabitants of Galilee into Assyria (<r>2 Kings 15:29; Isa. 9:1</r>). Subsequently Shalmaneser invaded Israel and laid siege to Samaria, the capital of the kingdom. During the siege he died, and was succeeded by Sargon, who took the city, and transported the great mass of the people into Assyria (B.C. 721), placing them in Halah and in Habor, and in the cities of the Medes (<r>2 Kings 17:3, 5</r>). Samaria was never again inhabited by the Israelites. The families thus removed were carried to distant cities, many of them not far from the Caspian Sea, and their place was supplied by colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. (<r>2 Kings 17:24</r>). Thus terminated the kingdom of the ten tribes, after a separate duration of two hundred and fifty-five years (B.C. 975-721)."},

The Hebrew word is from a root meaning 'to glitter,' 'lighten,' 'flash.' When held up to the sun, this gem shines like a burning coal, a dark-red glowing coal, and hence is called 'carbunculus', i.e., a little coal. It was one of the jewels in the first row of the high priest's breastplate. It has been conjectured by some that the garnet is meant. In Isa. 54:12 the Hebrew word is _'ekdah_, used in the prophetic description of the glory and beauty of the mansions above.

It was the capital of the kingdom of the northern Hittites. The Babylonian army, under Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, here met and conquered the army of Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt (B.C. 607).

A prominent headland of Central Palestine, consisting of several connected hills extending from the plain of Esdraelon to the sea, a distance of some 12 miles or more. At the east end, in its highest part, it is 1,728 feet high, and at the west end it forms a promontory to the bay of Acre about 600 feet above the sea. It lay within the tribe of Asher. It was here, at the east end of the ridge, at a place called el-Mukhrakah (i.e., the place of burning), that Elijah brought back the people to their allegiance to God, and slew the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). Here were consumed the 'fifties' of the royal guard; and here also Elisha received the visit of the bereaved mother whose son was restored by him to life (<r>2 Kings 4:25-37</r>). 'No mountain in or around Palestine retains its ancient beauty so much as Carmel. Two or three villages and some scattered cottages are found on it; its groves are few but luxuriant; it is no place for crags and precipices or rocks of wild goats; but its surface is covered with a rich and constant verdure.' 'The whole mountain-side is dressed with blossom, and flowering shrubs, and fragrant herbs.' The western extremity of the ridge is, however, more rocky and bleak than the eastern. The head of the bride in Cant. 7:5 is compared to Carmel. It is ranked with Bashan on account of its rich pastures (<r>Isa. 33:9; Jer. 50:19; Amos 1:2</r>). The whole ridge is deeply furrowed with rocky ravines filled with dense jungle. There are many caves in its sides, which at one time were inhabited by swarms of monks. These caves are referred to in Amos 9:3. To them Elijah and Elisha often resorted (<r>1 Kings 18:19, 42; 2 Kings 2:25</r>). On its north-west summit there is an ancient establishment of Carmelite monks. Vineyards have recently been planted on the mount by the German colonists of Haifa.

Enjoyments that minister to the wants and desires of man's animal nature are so called (<r>Rom. 15:27; 1 Cor. 9:11</r>). The ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of as 'carnal,' because it related to things outward, the bodies of men and of animals, and the purification of the flesh (<r>Heb. 7:16; 9:10</r>). The weapons of Christian warfare are 'not carnal', that is, they are not of man's device, nor are wielded by human power (<r>2 Cor. 10:4</r>)."},

The tools used by carpenters are mentioned in 1 Sam. 13:19, 20; Judg. 4:21; Isa. 10:15; 44:13. It was said of our Lord, 'Is not this the carpenter's son?' (<r>Matt. 13:55</r>); also, 'Is not this the carpenter?' (<r>Mark 6:3</r>). Every Jew, even the rabbis, learned some handicraft: Paul was a tentmaker.

In Isa. 46:1 (R.V., 'the things that ye carried about') the word means a load for a beast of burden. In 1 Sam. 17:22 and Isa. 10:28 it is the rendering of a word ('stuff' in 1 Sam. 10:22) meaning implements, equipments, baggage.

The Hebrew word thus rendered, _'agalah_ (<r>1 Sam. 6:7, 8</r>), is also rendered 'wagon' (<r>Gen. 45:19</r>). It is used also to denote a war-chariot (<r>Ps. 46:9</r>). Carts were used for the removal of the ark and its sacred utensils (<r>Num. 7:3, 6</r>). After retaining the ark amongst them for seven months, the Philistines sent it back to the Israelites. On this occasion they set it in a new cart, probably a rude construction, with solid wooden wheels like that still used in Western Asia, which was drawn by two milch cows, which conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh."},

Castles are also mentioned (<r>Gen. 25:16</r>) as a kind of watch-tower, from which shepherds kept watch over their flocks by night. The 'castle' into which the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought was the quarters of the Roman soldiers in the fortress of Antonia (so called by Herod after his patron Mark Antony), which was close to the north-west corner of the temple (<r>Acts 21:34</r>), which it commanded."},
{i:798,k:"Castor and Pollux",t:"the 'Dioscuri', two heroes of Greek and Roman mythology. Their figures were probably painted or sculptured on the prow of the ship which Luke refers to (<r>Acts 28:11</r>). They were regarded as the tutelary divinities of sailors. They appeared in the heavens as the constellation Gemini."},
{i:799,k:"Caterpillar",t:"the consumer. Used in the Old Testament (<r>1 Kings 8:37; 2 Chr. 6:28; Ps. 78:46; Isa. 33:4</r>) as the translation of a word (hasil) the root of which means 'to devour' or 'consume,' and which is used also with reference to the locust in Deut. 28:38. It may have been a species of locust, or the name of one of the transformations through which the locust passes, locust-grub. It is also found (<r>Ps. 105:34; Jer. 51:14, 27; R.V., 'cankerworm'</r>) as the rendering of a different Hebrew word, _yelek_, a word elsewhere rendered 'cankerworm' (q.v.), Joel 1:4; 2:25.

{i:803,k:"Cauls",t:"In Isa. 3:18 this word (Heb. shebisim), in the marg. 'networks,' denotes network caps to contain the hair, worn by females. Others explain it as meaning 'wreaths worn round the forehead, reaching from one ear to the other.'"},
{i:804,k:"Causeway",t:"a raised way, an ascent by steps, or a raised slope between Zion and the temple (<r>1 Chr. 26:16, 18</r>). In 2 Chr. 9:11 the same word is translated 'terrace.'"},

{i:806,k:"Cedar",t:"(Heb. e'rez, Gr. kedros, Lat. cedrus), a tree very frequently mentioned in Scripture. It was stately (<r>Ezek. 31:3-5</r>), long-branched (<r>Ps. 80:10; 92:12; Ezek. 31:6-9</r>), odoriferous (<r>Cant. 4:11; Hos. 14:6</r>), durable, and therefore much used for boards, pillars, and ceilings (<r>1 Kings 6:9, 10; 7:2; Jer. 22:14</r>), for masts (<r>Ezek. 27:5</r>), and for carved images (<r>Isa. 44:14</r>)."},

Ceilings were sometimes adorned with various ornaments in stucco, gold, silver, gems, and ivory. The ceilings of the temple and of Solomon's palace are described 1 Kings 6:9, 15; 7:3; 2 Chr. 3:5,9."},
{i:809,k:"Cellar",t:"a subterranean vault (<r>1 Chr. 27:28</r>), a storehouse. The word is also used to denote the treasury of the temple (<r>1 Kings 7:51</r>) and of the king (14:26). The Hebrew word is rendered 'garner' in Joel 1:17, and 'armoury' in Jer. 50:25."},
{i:810,k:"Cenchrea",t:"millet, the eastern harbour of Corinth, from which it was distant about 9 miles east, and the outlet for its trade with the Asiatic shores of the Mediterranean. When Paul returned from his second missionary journey to Syria, he sailed from this port (<r>Acts 18:18</r>). In Rom. 16:1 he speaks as if there were at the time of his writing that epistle an organized church there. The western harbour of Corinth was Lechaeum, about a mile and a half from the city. It was the channel of its trade with Italy and the west."},
{i:811,k:"Censer",t:"the vessel in which incense was presented on 'the golden altar' before the Lord in the temple (<r>Ex. 30:1-9</r>). The priest filled the censer with live coal from the sacred fire on the altar of burnt-offering, and having carried it into the sanctuary, there threw upon the burning coals the sweet incense (<r>Lev. 16:12, 13</r>), which sent up a cloud of smoke, filling the apartment with fragrance. The censers in daily use were of brass (<r>Num. 16:39</r>), and were designated by a different Hebrew name, _miktereth_ (<r>2 Chr. 26:19; Ezek. 8:11</r>): while those used on the day of Atonement were of gold, and were denoted by a word (mahtah) meaning 'something to take fire with;' LXX. pureion = a fire-pan. Solomon prepared for the temple censers of pure gold (<r>1 Kings 7:50; 2 Chr. 4:22</r>). The angel in the Apocalypse is represented with a golden censer (<r>Rev. 8:3, 5</r>). Paul speaks of the golden censer as belonging to the tabernacle (<r>Heb. 9:4</r>). The Greek word thumiaterion, here rendered 'censer,' may more appropriately denote, as in the margin of Revised Version, 'the altar of incense.' Paul does not here say that the thumiaterion was in the holiest, for it was in the holy place, but that the holiest had it, i.e., that it belonged to the holiest (<r>1 Kings 6:22</r>). It was intimately connected with the high priest's service in the holiest."},
{i:812,k:"Census",t:"There are five instances of a census of the Jewish people having been taken. (1.) In the fourth month after the Exodus, when the people were encamped at Sinai. The number of men from twenty years old and upward was then 603,550 (<r>Ex. 38:26</r>). (2.) Another census was made just before the entrance into Canaan, when the number was found to be 601,730, showing thus a small decrease (<r>Num. 26:51</r>). (3.) The next census was in the time of David, when the number, exclusive of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, was found to be 1,300,000 (<r>2 Sam. 24:9; 1 Chr. 21:5</r>). (4.) Solomon made a census of the foreigners in the land, and found 153,600 able-bodied workmen (<r>2 Chr. 2:17, 18</r>). (5.) After the return from Exile the whole congregation of Israel was numbered, and found to amount to 42,360 (<r>Ezra 2:64</r>). A census was made by the Roman government in the time of our Lord (<r>Luke 2:1</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See TAXING.</see>)"},
{i:813,k:"Centurion",t:"a Roman officer in command of a hundred men (<r>Mark 15:39, 44, 45</r>). Cornelius, the first Gentile convert, was a centurion (<r>Acts 10:1, 22</r>). Other centurions are mentioned in Matt. 8:5, 8, 13; Luke 7:2, 6; Acts 21:32; 22:25, 26; 23:17, 23; 24:23; 27:1, 6, 11, 31, 43; 28:16. A centurion watched the crucifixion of our Lord (<r>Matt. 27:54; Luke 23:47</r>), and when he saw the wonders attending it, exclaimed, 'Truly this man was the Son of God.' 'The centurions mentioned in the New Testament are uniformly spoken of in terms of praise, whether in the Gospels or in the Acts. It is interesting to compare this with the statement of Polybius (vi. 24), that the centurions were chosen by merit, and so were men remarkable not so much for their daring courage as for their deliberation, constancy, and strength of mind.', Dr. Maclear's N. T. Hist."},

{i:816,k:"Chaff",t:"the refuse of winnowed corn. It was usually burned (<r>Ex. 15:7; Isa. 5:24; Matt. 3:12</r>). This word sometimes, however, means dried grass or hay (<r>Isa. 5:24; 33:11</r>). Chaff is used as a figure of abortive wickedness (<r>Ps. 1:4; Matt. 3:12</r>). False doctrines are also called chaff (<r>Jer. 23:28</r>), or more correctly rendered 'chopped straw.' The destruction of the wicked, and their powerlessness, are likened to the carrying away of chaff by the wind (<r>Isa. 17:13; Hos. 13:3; Zeph. 2:2</r>)."},
{i:817,k:"Chain",t:"(1.) A part of the insignia of office. A chain of gold was placed about Joseph's neck (<r>Gen. 41:42</r>); and one was promised to Daniel (5:7). It is used as a symbol of sovereignty (<r>Ezek. 16:11</r>). The breast-plate of the high-priest was fastened to the ephod by golden chains (<r>Ex. 39:17, 21</r>)."},
{i:818,k:"Chalcedony",t:"Mentioned only in Rev. 21:19, as one of the precious stones in the foundation of the New Jerusalem. The name of this stone is derived from Chalcedon, where it is said to have been first discovered. In modern mineralogy this is the name of an agate-like quartz of a bluish colour. Pliny so names the Indian ruby. The mineral intended in Revelation is probably the Hebrew _nophekh_, translated 'emerald' (<r>Ex. 28:18; 39:11; Ezek. 27:16; 28:13</r>). It is rendered 'anthrax' in the LXX., and 'carbunculus' in the Vulgate. (<see target='x-self'>See CARBUNCLE.</see>)"},
{i:819,k:"Chaldea",t:"The southern portion of Babylonia, Lower Mesopotamia, lying chiefly on the right bank of the Euphrates, but commonly used of the whole of the Mesopotamian plain. The Hebrew name is Kasdim, which is usually rendered 'Chaldeans' (<r>Jer. 50:10; 51:24,35</r>)."},
{i:820,k:"Chaldee language",t:"employed by the sacred writers in certain portions of the Old Testament, viz., Dan. 2:4-7, 28; Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26; Gen. 31:46; Jer. 10:11. It is the Aramaic dialect, as it is sometimes called, as distinguished from the Hebrew dialect. It was the language of commerce and of social intercourse in Western Asia, and after the Exile gradually came to be the popular language of Palestine. It is called 'Syrian' in 2 Kings 18:26. Some isolated words in this language are preserved in the New Testament (<r>Matt. 5:22; 6:24; 16:17; 27:46; Mark 3:17; 5:41; 7:34; 14:36; Acts 1:19; 1 Cor. 16:22</r>). These are specimens of the vernacular language of Palestine at that period. The term 'Hebrew' was also sometimes applied to the Chaldee because it had become the language of the Hebrews (<r>John 5:2; 19:20</r>)."},
{i:821,k:"Chaldees",t:"or Chaldeans, the inhabitants of the country of which Babylon was the capital. They were so called till the time of the Captivity (2 Kings 25; Isa. 13:19; 23:13), when, particularly in the Book of Daniel (5:30; 9:1), the name began to be used with special reference to a class of learned men ranked with the magicians and astronomers. These men cultivated the ancient Cushite language of the original inhabitants of the land, for they had a 'learning' and a 'tongue' (1:4) of their own. The common language of the country at that time had become assimilated to the Semitic dialect, especially through the influence of the Assyrians, and was the language that was used for all civil purposes. The Chaldeans were the learned class, interesting themselves in science and religion, which consisted, like that of the ancient Arabians and Syrians, in the worship of the heavenly bodies. There are representations of this priestly class, of magi and diviners, on the walls of the Assyrian palaces."},
{i:822,k:"Chamber",t:"'on the wall,' which the Shunammite prepared for the prophet Elisha (<r>2 Kings 4:10</r>), was an upper chamber over the porch through the hall toward the street. This was the 'guest chamber' where entertainments were prepared (<r>Mark 14:14</r>). There were also 'chambers within chambers' (<r>1 Kings 22:25; 2 Kings 9:2</r>). To enter into a chamber is used metaphorically of prayer and communion with God (<r>Isa. 26:20</r>). The 'chambers of the south' (<r>Job 9:9</r>) are probably the constelations of the southern hemisphere. The 'chambers of imagery', i.e., chambers painted with images, as used by Ezekiel (8:12), is an expression denoting the vision the prophet had of the abominations practised by the Jews in Jerusalem."},

{i:824,k:"Chamberlain",t:"a confidential servant of the king (<r>Gen. 37:36; 39:1</r>). In Rom. 16:23 mention is made of 'Erastus the chamberlain.' Here the word denotes the treasurer of the city, or the quaestor, as the Romans styled him. He is almost the only convert from the higher ranks of whom mention is made (<r>comp. Acts 17:34</r>). Blastus, Herod's 'chamberlain' (<r>Acts 12:20</r>), was his personal attendant or valet-de-chambre. The Hebrew word _saris_, thus translated in Esther 1:10, 15; 2:3, 14, 21, etc., properly means an eunuch (as in the marg.), as it is rendered in Isa. 39:7; 56:3."},
{i:825,k:"Chameleon",t:"a species of lizard which has the faculty of changing the colour of its skin. It is ranked among the unclean animals in Lev. 11:30, where the Hebrew word so translated is _coah_ (R.V., 'land crocodile'). In the same verse the Hebrew _tanshemeth_, rendered in Authorized Version 'mole,' is in Revised Version 'chameleon,' which is the correct rendering. This animal is very common in Egypt and in the Holy Land, especially in the Jordan valley."},
{i:826,k:"Chamois",t:"only in Deut. 14:5 (Heb. zemer), an animal of the deer or gazelle species. It bears this Hebrew name from its leaping or springing. The animal intended is probably the wild sheep (Ovis tragelephus), which is still found in Sinai and in the broken ridges of Stony Arabia. The LXX. and Vulgate render the word by camelopardus, i.e., the giraffe; but this is an animal of Central Africa, and is not at all known in Syria."},
{i:827,k:"Champion",t:"(<r>1 Sam. 17:4, 23</r>), properly 'the man between the two,' denoting the position of Goliath between the two camps. Single combats of this kind at the head of armies were common in ancient times. In ver. 51 this word is the rendering of a different Hebrew word, and properly denotes 'a mighty man.'"},
{i:828,k:"Chance",t:"(<r>Luke 10:31</r>). 'It was not by chance that the priest came down by that road at that time, but by a specific arrangement and in exact fulfilment of a plan; not the plan of the priest, nor the plan of the wounded traveller, but the plan of God. By coincidence (Gr. sungkuria) the priest came down, that is, by the conjunction of two things, in fact, which were previously constituted a pair in the providence of God. In the result they fell together according to the omniscient Designer's plan. This is the true theory of the divine government.' Compare the meeting of Philip with the Ethiopian (<r>Acts 8:26, 27</r>). There is no 'chance' in God's empire. 'Chance' is only another word for our want of knowledge as to the way in which one event falls in with another (<r>1 Sam. 6:9; Eccl. 9:11</r>)."},

{i:832,k:"Daric",t:"in the Revised Version of 1 Chr. 29:7; Ezra 2:69; 8:27; Neh. 7:70-72, where the Authorized Version has 'dram.' It is the rendering of the Hebrew darkemon and the Greek dareikos. It was a gold coin, bearing the figure of a Persian King with his crown and armed with bow and arrow. It was current among the Jews after their return from Babylon, i.e., while under the Persian domination. It weighed about 128 grains troy, and was of the value of about one guinea or rather more of our money. It is the first coin mentioned in Scripture, and is the oldest that history makes known to us."},
{i:833,k:"Darius",t:"the holder or supporter, the name of several Persian kings. (1.) Darius the Mede (<r>Dan. 11:1</r>), 'the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes' (9:1). On the death of Belshazzar the Chaldean he 'received the kingdom' of Babylon as viceroy from Cyrus. During his brief reign (B.C. 538-536) Daniel was promoted to the highest dignity (<r>Dan. 6:1, 2</r>); but on account of the malice of his enemies he was cast into the den of lions. After his miraculous escape, a decree was issued by Darius enjoining 'reverence for the God of Daniel' (6:26). This king was probably the 'Astyages' of the Greek historians. Nothing can, however, be with certainty affirmed regarding him. Some are of opinion that the name 'Darius' is simply a name of office, equivalent to 'governor,' and that the 'Gobryas' of the inscriptions was the person intended by the name."},
{i:834,k:"Darkness",t:"The plague (the ninth) of darkness in Egypt (<r>Ex. 10:21</r>) is described as darkness 'which may be felt.' It covered 'all the land of Egypt,' so that 'they saw not one another.' It did not extend to the land of Goshen (ver. 23)."},
{i:835,k:"Darling",t:"Ps. 22:20; 35:17) means an 'only one.'"},
{i:836,k:"Dart",t:"an instrument of war; a light spear. 'Fiery darts' (<r>Eph. 6:16</r>) are so called in allusion to the habit of discharging darts from the bow while they are on fire or armed with some combustible material. Arrows are compared to lightning (<r>Deut. 32:23, 42; Ps. 7:13; 120:4</r>)."},
{i:837,k:"Date",t:"the fruit of a species of palm (q.v.), the Phoenix dactilifera. This was a common tree in Palestine (<r>Joel 1:12; Neh. 8:15</r>). Palm branches were carried by the Jews on festive occasions, and especially at the feast of Tabernacles (<r>Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15</r>)."},

Women as natives of a place, or as professing the religion of a place; as, 'the daughters of Zion' (<r>Isa. 3:16</r>), 'daughters of the Philistines' (<r>2 Sam. 1:20</r>). (3.) Small towns and villages lying around a city are its 'daughters,' as related to the metropolis or mother city. Tyre is in this sense called the daughter of Sidon (<r>Isa. 23:12</r>). (4.) The people of Jerusalem are spoken of as 'the daughters of Zion' (<r>Isa. 37:22</r>). (5.) The daughters of a tree are its boughs (<r>Gen. 49:22</r>). (6.) The 'daughters of music' (<r>Eccl. 12:4</r>) are singing women."},

This was the name afterwards given to the castle and royal palace on Mount Zion, as distinguished from Jerusalem generally (<r>1 Kings 3:1; 8:1</r>), It was on the south-west side of Jerusalem, opposite the temple mount, with which it was connected by a bridge over the Tyropoeon valley."},
{i:842,k:"Day",t:"The Jews reckoned the day from sunset to sunset (<r>Lev. 23:32</r>). It was originally divided into three parts (<r>Ps. 55:17</r>). 'The heat of the day' (<r>1 Sam. 11:11; Neh. 7:3</r>) was at our nine o'clock, and 'the cool of the day' just before sunset (<r>Gen. 3:8</r>). Before the Captivity the Jews divided the night into three watches, (1) from sunset to midnight (<r>Lam. 2:19</r>); (2) from midnight till the cock-crowing (<r>Judg. 7:19</r>); and (3) from the cock-crowing till sunrise (<r>Ex. 14:24</r>).

{i:847,k:"Deacon",t:"Anglicized form of the Greek word diaconos, meaning a 'runner,' 'messenger,' 'servant.' For a long period a feeling of mutual jealousy had existed between the 'Hebrews,' or Jews proper, who spoke the sacred language of palestine, and the 'Hellenists,' or Jews of the Grecian speech, who had adopted the Grecian language, and read the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the Hebrew. This jealousy early appeared in the Christian community. It was alleged by the Hellenists that their widows were overlooked in the daily distribution of alms. This spirit must be checked. The apostles accordingly advised the disciples to look out for seven men of good report, full of the Holy Ghost, and men of practical wisdom, who should take entire charge of this distribution, leaving them free to devote themselves entirely to the spiritual functions of their office (<r>Acts 6:1-6</r>). This was accordingly done. Seven men were chosen, who appear from their names to have been Hellenists. The name 'deacon' is nowhere applied to them in the New Testament; they are simply called 'the seven' (21:8). Their office was at first secular, but it afterwards became also spiritual; for among other qualifications they must also be 'apt to teach' (<r>1 Tim. 3: 8-12</r>). Both Philip and Stephen, who were of 'the seven,' preached; they did 'the work of evangelists.'"},

The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it (<see target='x-self'>see JORDAN</see>), is maintained with little variation.

It was originally one of the towns of the Anakim (<r>Josh. 15:15</r>), and was also called Kirjath-sepher (q.v.) and Kirjath-sannah (49). Caleb, who had conquered and taken possession of the town and district of Hebron (<r>Josh. 14:6-15</r>), offered the hand of his daughter to any one who would successfully lead a party against Debir. Othniel, his younger brother (<r>Judg. 1:13; 3:9</r>), achieved the conquest, and gained Achsah as his wife. She was not satisfied with the portion her father gave her, and as she was proceeding toward her new home, she 'lighted from off her ass' and said to him, 'Give me a blessing [i.e., a dowry]: for thou hast given me a south land' (<r>Josh. 15:19, A.V.</r>); or, as in the Revised Version, 'Thou hast set me in the land of the south', i.e., in the Negeb, outside the rich valley of Hebron, in the dry and barren land.

The fifth of these books was called by the Greeks Deuteronomion, i.e., the second law, hence our name Deuteronomy, or a second statement of the laws already promulgated. The Jews designated the book by the two first Hebrew words that occur, _'Elle haddabharim_, i.e., 'These are the words.' They divided it into eleven _parshioth_.

From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of climate from which poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago (<r>Gen. 31:40</r>). To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands. At sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindling light the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate masses and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated by the increasing heat. These are 'the morning clouds and the early dew that go away' of which Hosea (6:4; 13:3) speaks so touchingly' (Geikie's The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a source of great fertility (<r>Gen. 27:28; Deut. 33:13; Zech. 8:12</r>), and its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God (<r>2 Sam. 1:21; 1 Kings 17:1</r>). It is the symbol of a multitude (<r>2 Sam. 17:12; Ps. 110:3</r>); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem of brotherly love and harmony (<r>Ps. 133:3</r>), and of rich spiritual blessings (<r>Hos. 14:5</r>)."},

In the New Testament a careful distinction is drawn between the diadem as a badge of royalty (<r>Rev. 12:3; 13:1; 19:12</r>) and the crown as a mark of distinction in private life.

At the centre, hidden by curtains, within a gorgeous shrine, stood the very ancient image of the goddess, on wood or ebony reputed to have fallen from the sky. Behind the shrine was a treasury, where, as in 'the safest bank in Asia,' nations and kings stored their most precious things.

Its luxurious climate attracted to it many Greek residents after its incorporation with the Macedonian empire. It was formed into a Roman province, B.C. 67. The Jews of Cilicia had a synagogue at Jerusalem (<r>Acts 6:9</r>). Paul visited it soon after his conversion (<r>Gal. 1:21; Acts 9:30</r>), and again, on his second missionary journey (15:41), 'he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.'

There is no trace of it in Egypt, and it was unknown in Syria. The inner rind when dried and rolled into cylinders forms the cinnamon of commerce. The fruit and coarser pieces of bark when boiled yield a fragrant oil. It was one of the principal ingredients in the holy anointing oil (<r>Ex. 30:23</r>). It is mentioned elsewhere only in Prov. 7:17; Cant. 4:14; Rev. 18:13. The mention of it indicates a very early and extensive commerce carried on between Palestine and the East."},

In compliance with the divine command, Abraham, though ninety-nine years of age, was circumcised on the same day with Ishmael, who was thirteen years old (17:24-27). Slaves, whether home-born or purchased, were circumcised (17:12, 13); and all foreigners must have their males circumcised before they could enjoy the privileges of Jewish citizenship (<r>Ex. 12:48</r>). During the journey through the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell into disuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before they entered the Promised Land (<r>Josh. 5:2-9</r>). It was observed always afterwards among the tribes of israel, although it is not expressly mentioned from the time of the settlement in Canaan till the time of Christ, about 1,450 years. The Jews prided themselves in the possession of this covenant distinction (<r>Judg. 14:3; 15:18; 1 Sam. 14:6; 17:26; 2 Sam. 1:20; Ezek. 31:18</r>)."},

Damascus is said to be the oldest existing city in the world. Before the time of Abraham there were cities in Egypt (<r>Num. 13:22</r>). The Israelites in Egypt were employed in building the 'treasure cities' of Pithom and Raamses (<r>Ex. 1:11</r>); but it does not seem that they had any cities of their own in Goshen (<r>Gen. 46:34; 47:1-11</r>). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were sixty 'great cities with walls,' and twenty-three cities in Gilead partly rebuilt by the tribes on the east of Jordan (<r>Num. 21:21, 32, 33, 35; 32:1-3, 34-42; Deut. 3:4, 5, 14; 1 Kings 4:13</r>).

Clay was used for sealing (<r>Job 38:14; Jer. 32:14</r>). Our Lord's tomb may have been thus sealed (<r>Matt. 27:66</r>). The practice of sealing doors with clay is still common in the East. Clay was also in primitive times used for mortar (<r>Gen. 11:3</r>). The 'clay ground' in which the large vessels of the temple were cast (<r>1 Kings 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17</r>) was a compact loam fitted for the purpose.

It was an opinion of ancient writers that he was the Clement of Rome whose name is well known in church history, and that he was the author of an Epistle to the Corinthians, the only known manuscript of which is appended to the Alexandrian Codex, now in the British Museum. It is of some historical interest, and has given rise to much discussion among critics. It makes distinct reference to Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians."},
{i:906,k:"Cleopas",t:"(abbreviation of Cleopatros), one of the two disciples with whom Jesus conversed on the way to Emmaus on the day of the resurrection (<r>Luke 24:18</r>). We know nothing definitely regarding him. It is not certain that he was the Clopas of John 19:25, or the Alphaeus of Matt. 10:3, although he may have been so."},
{i:907,k:"Cleophas",t:"(in the spelling of this word _h_ is inserted by mistake from Latin MSS.), rather Cleopas, which is the Greek form of the word, while Clopas is the Aramaic form. In John 19:25 the Authorized Version reads, 'Mary, the wife of Clopas.' The word 'wife' is conjecturally inserted here. If 'wife' is rightly inserted, then Mary was the mother of James the Less, and Clopas is the same as Alphaeus (<r>Matt. 10:3; 27:56</r>)."},
{i:908,k:"Cloak",t:"an upper garment, 'an exterior tunic, wide and long, reaching to the ankles, but without sleeves' (<r>Isa. 59:17</r>). The word so rendered is elsewhere rendered 'robe' or 'mantle.' It was worn by the high priest under the ephod (<r>Ex. 28:31</r>), by kings and others of rank (<r>1 Sam. 15:27; Job 1:20; 2:12</r>), and by women (<r>2 Sam. 13:18</r>)."},
{i:909,k:"Closet",t:"as used in the New Testament, signifies properly a storehouse (<r>Luke 12: 24</r>), and hence a place of privacy and retirement (<r>Matt. 6:6; Luke 12:3</r>)."},
{i:910,k:"Cloud",t:"The Hebrew so rendered means 'a covering,' because clouds cover the sky. The word is used as a symbol of the Divine presence, as indicating the splendour of that glory which it conceals (<r>Ex. 16:10; 33:9; Num. 11:25; 12:5; Job 22:14; Ps. 18:11</r>). A 'cloud without rain' is a proverbial saying, denoting a man who does not keep his promise (<r>Prov. 16:15; Isa. 18:4; 25:5; Jude 1:12</r>). A cloud is the figure of that which is transitory (<r>Job 30:15; Hos. 6:4</r>). A bright cloud is the symbolical seat of the Divine presence (<r>Ex.29:42, 43; 1 Kings 8:10; 2 Chr. 5:14; Ezek. 43:4</r>), and was called the Shechinah (q.v.). Jehovah came down upon Sinai in a cloud (<r>Ex. 19:9</r>); and the cloud filled the court around the tabernacle in the wilderness so that Moses could not enter it (<r>Ex. 40:34, 35</r>). At the dedication of the temple also the cloud 'filled the house of the Lord' (<r>1 Kings 8:10</r>). Thus in like manner when Christ comes the second time he is described as coming 'in the clouds' (<r>Matt. 17:5; 24:30; Acts 1:9, 11</r>). False teachers are likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest (<r>2 Pet. 2:17</r>). The infirmities of old age, which come one after another, are compared by Solomon to 'clouds returning after the rain' (<r>Eccl. 12:2</r>). The blotting out of sins is like the sudden disappearance of threatening clouds from the sky (<r>Isa. 44:22</r>)."},
{i:911,k:"Cnidus",t:"a town and harbour on the extreme south-west of the peninsula of Doris in Asia Minor. Paul sailed past it on his voyage to Rome after leaving Myra (<r>Acts 27:7</r>)."},
{i:912,k:"Coal",t:"It is by no means certain that the Hebrews were acquainted with mineral coal, although it is found in Syria. Their common fuel was dried dung of animals and wood charcoal. Two different words are found in Hebrew to denote coal, both occurring in Prov. 26:21, 'As coal [Heb. peham; i.e., 'black coal'] is to burning coal [Heb. gehalim].' The latter of these words is used in Job 41:21; Prov. 6:28; Isa. 44:19. The words 'live coal' in Isa. 6:6 are more correctly 'glowing stone.' In Lam. 4:8 the expression 'blacker than a coal' is literally rendered in the margin of the Revised Version 'darker than blackness.' 'Coals of fire' (<r>2 Sam. 22:9, 13; Ps. 18:8, 12, 13, etc.</r>) is an expression used metaphorically for lightnings proceeding from God. A false tongue is compared to 'coals of juniper' (<r>Ps. 120:4; James 3:6</r>). 'Heaping coals of fire on the head' symbolizes overcoming evil with good. The words of Paul (<r>Rom. 12:20</r>) are equivalent to saying, 'By charity and kindness thou shalt soften down his enmity as surely as heaping coals on the fire fuses the metal in the crucible.'"},
{i:913,k:"Coat",t:"the tunic worn like the shirt next the skin (<r>Lev. 16:4; Cant. 5:3; 2 Sam. 15:32; Ex. 28:4; 29:5</r>). The 'coats of skins' prepared by God for Adam and Eve were probably nothing more than aprons (<r>Gen. 3:21</r>). This tunic was sometimes woven entire without a seam (<r>John 19:23</r>); it was also sometimes of 'many colours' (<r>Gen. 37:3; R.V. marg., 'a long garment with sleeves'</r>). The 'fisher's coat' of John 21:7 was obviously an outer garment or cloak, as was also the 'coat' made by Hannah for Samuel (<r>1 Sam. 2:19</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See DRESS.</see>)"},
{i:914,k:"Coat of mail",t:"the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning 'glittering' (<r>1 Sam. 17:5, 38</r>). The same word in the plural form is translated 'habergeons' in 2 Chr. 26:14 and Neh. 4:16. The 'harness' (<r>1 Kings 22:34</r>), 'breastplate' (<r>Isa. 59:17</r>), and 'brigandine' (<r>Jer. 46:4</r>), were probably also corselets or coats of mail.

{i:915,k:"Cock-crowing",t:"In our Lord's time the Jews had adopted the Greek and Roman division of the night into four watches, each consisting of three hours, the first beginning at six o'clock in the evening (<r>Luke 12:38; Matt. 14:25; Mark 6:48</r>). But the ancient division, known as the first and second cock-crowing, was still retained. The cock usually crows several times soon after midnight (this is the first crowing), and again at the dawn of day (and this is the second crowing). Mark mentions (14:30) the two cock-crowings. Matthew (26:34) alludes to that only which was emphatically the cock-crowing, viz, the second."},
{i:916,k:"Cockatrice",t:"the mediaeval name (a corruption of 'crocodile') of a fabulous serpent supposed to be produced from a cock's egg. It is generally supposed to denote the cerastes, or 'horned viper,' a very poisonous serpent about a foot long. Others think it to be the yellow viper (Daboia xanthina), one of the most dangerous vipers, from its size and its nocturnal habits (<r>Isa. 11:8; 14:29; 59:5; Jer. 8:17; in all which the Revised Version renders the Hebrew _tziph'oni_ by 'basilisk'</r>). In Prov. 23:32 the Hebrew _tzeph'a_ is rendered both in the Authorized Version and the Revised Version by 'adder;' margin of Revised Version 'basilisk,' and of Authorized Version 'cockatrice.'"},
{i:917,k:"Cockle",t:"occurs only in Job 31:40 (marg., 'noisome weeds'), where it is the rendering of a Hebrew word (b'oshah) which means 'offensive,' 'having a bad smell,' referring to some weed perhaps which has an unpleasant odour. Or it may be regarded as simply any noisome weed, such as the 'tares' or darnel of Matt. 13:30. In Isa. 5:2, 4 the plural form is rendered 'wild grapes.'"},
{i:918,k:"Coele-Syria",t:"hollow Syria, the name (not found in Scripture) given by the Greeks to the extensive valley, about 100 miles long, between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon range of mountains."},
{i:919,k:"Coffer",t:"the receptacle or small box placed beside the ark by the Philistines, in which they deposited the golden mice and the emerods as their trespass-offering (<r>1 Sam. 6:8, 11, 15</r>)."},
{i:920,k:"Coffin",t:"used in Gen. 50:26 with reference to the burial of Joseph. Here, it means a mummy-chest. The same Hebrew word is rendered 'chest' in 2 Kings 12:9, 10."},

{i:922,k:"Coin",t:"Before the Exile the Jews had no regularly stamped money. They made use of uncoined shekels or talents of silver, which they weighed out (<r>Gen. 23:16; Ex. 38:24; 2 Sam. 18:12</r>). Probably the silver ingots used in the time of Abraham may have been of a fixed weight, which was in some way indicated on them. The 'pieces of silver' paid by Abimelech to Abraham (<r>Gen. 20:16</r>), and those also for which Joseph was sold (37:28), were proably in the form of rings. The shekel was the common standard of weight and value among the Hebrews down to the time of the Captivity. Only once is a shekel of gold mentioned (<r>1 Chr. 21:25</r>). The 'six thousand of gold' mentioned in the transaction between Naaman and Gehazi (<r>2 Kings 5:5</r>) were probably so many shekels of gold. The 'piece of money' mentioned in Job 42:11; Gen. 33:19 (marg., 'lambs') was the Hebrew _kesitah_, probably an uncoined piece of silver of a certain weight in the form of a sheep or lamb, or perhaps having on it such an impression. The same Hebrew word is used in Josh. 24:32, which is rendered by Wickliffe 'an hundred yonge scheep.'"},
{i:923,k:"Collar",t:"(Heb. peh), means in Job 30:18 the mouth or opening of the garment that closes round the neck in the same way as a tunic (<r>Ex. 39:23</r>). The 'collars' (Heb. netiphoth) among the spoils of the Midianites (<r>Judg. 8:26; R.V., 'pendants'</r>) were ear-drops. The same Hebrew word is rendered 'chains' in Isa. 3:19."},

{i:925,k:"College",t:"Heb. mishneh (<r>2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chr. 34:22</r>), rendered in Revised Version 'second quarter', the residence of the prophetess Huldah. The Authorized Version followed the Jewish commentators, who, following the Targum, gave the Hebrew word its post-Biblical sense, as if it meant a place of instruction. It properly means the 'second,' and may therefore denote the lower city (Acra), which was built after the portion of the city on Mount Zion, and was enclosed by a second wall."},
{i:926,k:"Colony",t:"The city of Philippi was a Roman colony (<r>Acts 16:12</r>), i.e., a military settlement of Roman soldiers and citizens, planted there to keep in subjection a newly-conquered district. A colony was Rome in miniature, under Roman municipal law, but governed by military officers (praetors and lictors), not by proconsuls. It had an independent internal government, the jus Italicum; i.e., the privileges of Italian citizens."},
{i:927,k:"Colossae",t:"or Colosse, a city of Phrygia, on the Lycus, which is a tributary of the Maeander. It was about 12 miles above Laodicea, and near the great road from Ephesus to the Euphrates, and was consequently of some mercantile importance. It does not appear that Paul had visited this city when he wrote his letter to the church there (<r>Col. 1:2</r>). He expresses in his letter to Philemon (<r>ver. 1:22</r>) his hope to visit it on being delivered from his imprisonment. From Col. 1:7; 4:12 it has been concluded that Epaphras was the founder of the Colossian church. This town afterwards fell into decay, and the modern town of Chonas or Chonum occupies a site near its ruins."},
{i:928,k:"Colossians, Epistle to the",t:"was written by Paul at Rome during his first imprisonment there (<r>Acts 28:16, 30</r>), probably in the spring of A.D. 57, or, as some think, 62, and soon after he had written his Epistle to the Ephesians. Like some of his other epistles (e.g., those to Corinth), this seems to have been written in consequence of information which had somehow been conveyed to him of the internal state of the church there (<r>Col. 1:4-8</r>). Its object was to counteract false teaching. A large part of it is directed against certain speculatists who attempted to combine the doctrines of Oriental mysticism and asceticism with Christianity, thereby promising the disciples the enjoyment of a higher spiritual life and a deeper insight into the world of spirits. Paul argues against such teaching, showing that in Christ Jesus they had all things. He sets forth the majesty of his redemption. The mention of the 'new moon' and 'sabbath days' (2:16) shows also that there were here Judaizing teachers who sought to draw away the disciples from the simplicity of the gospel."},

The same Greek word thus rendered is translated 'Advocate' in 1 John 2:1 as applicable to Christ. It means properly 'one who is summoned to the side of another' to help him in a court of justice by defending him, 'one who is summoned to plead a cause.' 'Advocate' is the proper rendering of the word in every case where it occurs."},

These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt (<r>Ex. 19:10-25</r>). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount (32:19), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them 'the words that were on the first tables' (34:1). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant (<r>Deut. 10:5; 1 Kings 8:9</r>). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called 'the covenant' (<r>Deut. 4:13</r>), and 'the tables of the covenant' (9:9, 11; Heb. 9:4), and 'the testimony.'"},

{i:935,k:"Concision",t:"(Gr. katatome; i.e., 'mutilation'), a term used by Paul contemptuously of those who were zealots for circumcision (<r>Phil. 3:2</r>). Instead of the warning, 'Beware of the circumcision' (peritome) i.e., of the party who pressed on Gentile converts the necessity of still observing that ordinance, he says, 'Beware of the concision;' as much as to say, 'This circumcision which they vaunt of is in Christ only as the gashings and mutilations of idolatrous heathen.'"},

Among the early Jews, from various causes, the difference between a wife and a concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The concubine was a wife of secondary rank. There are various laws recorded providing for their protection (<r>Ex. 21:7; Deut. 21:10-14</r>), and setting limits to the relation they sustained to the household to which they belonged (<r>Gen. 21:14; 25:6</r>).

In carrying out this work he stopped 'the waters of the fountains which were without the city' i.e., 'the upper water-course of Gihon', and conveyed it down from the west through a canal into the city, so that in case of a siege the inhabitants of the city might have a supply of water, which would thus be withdrawn from the enemy.

But here the king of Babylon must be taken as expressing himself according to his own heathen notions, and not according to those of the Jews. The 'mount of the congregation' will therefore in this case mean the northern mountain, supposed by the Babylonians to be the meeting-place of their gods.

In Isa. 13:10, where this word only occurs, it is the rendering of the Hebrew _kesil_, i.e., 'fool.' This was the Hebrew name of the constellation Orion (<r>Job 9:9; 38:31</r>), a constellation which represented Nimrod, the symbol of folly and impiety. The word some interpret by 'the giant' in this place, 'some heaven-daring rebel who was chained to the sky for his impiety.'"},

It arises from the inward disposition, and is the offspring of humility, and of an intelligent consideration of the rectitude and benignity of divine providence (<r>Ps. 96:1, 2; 145</r>), the greatness of the divine promises (<r>2 Pet. 1:4</r>), and our own unworthiness (<r>Gen. 32:10</r>); as well as from the view the gospel opens up to us of rest and peace hereafter (<r>Rom. 5:2</r>)."},

Thus we speak of the conversion of the Philippian jailer (16:19-34), of Paul (9:1-22), of the Ethiopian treasurer (8:26-40), of Cornelius (10), of Lydia (16:13-15), and others. (See REGENERATION"},

Few animals, as a rule, were slaughtered (other than sacrifices), except for purposes of hospitality (<r>Gen. 18:7; Luke 15:23</r>). The paschal lamb was roasted over a fire (<r>Ex. 12:8, 9; 2Chr. 35:13</r>). Cooking by boiling was the usual method adopted (<r>Lev. 8:31; Ex. 16:23</r>).

{i:954,k:"Coos",t:"(written Cos in the R.V.), a small island, one of the Sporades in the Aegean Sea, in the north-west of Rhodes, off the coast of Caria. Paul on his return from his third missionary journey, passed the night here after sailing from Miletus (<r>Acts 21:1</r>). It is now called Stanchio."},
{i:955,k:"Copper",t:"derived from the Greek kupros (the island of Cyprus), called 'Cyprian brass,' occurs only in the Authorized Version in Ezra 8:27. Elsewhere the Hebrew word (nehosheth) is improperly rendered 'brass,' and sometimes 'steel' (<r>2 Sam. 22:35; Jer. 15:12</r>). The 'bow of steel' (<r>Job 20:24; Ps. 18:34</r>) should have been 'bow of copper' (or 'brass,' as in the R.V.). The vessels of 'fine copper' of Ezra 8:27 were probably similar to those of 'bright brass' mentioned in 1 Kings 7:45; Dan. 10:6."},
{i:956,k:"Cor",t:"This Hebrew word, untranslated, denotes a round vessel used as a measure both for liquids and solids. It was equal to one homer, and contained ten ephahs in dry and ten baths in liquid measure (<r>Ezek. 45:14</r>). The Rabbins estimated the cor at forty-five gallons, while Josephus estimated it at about eighty-seven. In 1 Kings 4:22; 5:11; 2 Chr. 2:10; 27:5, the original word is rendered 'measure.'"},
{i:957,k:"Coral",t:"Heb. ramoth, meaning 'heights;' i.e., 'high-priced' or valuable things, or, as some suppose, 'that which grows high,' like a tree (<r>Job 28:18; Ezek. 27:16</r>), according to the Rabbins, red coral, which was in use for ornaments."},
{i:958,k:"Corban",t:"a Hebrew word adopted into the Greek of the New Testament and left untranslated. It occurs only once (<r>Mark 7:11</r>). It means a gift or offering consecrated to God. Anything over which this word was once pronounced was irrevocably dedicated to the temple. Land, however, so dedicated might be redeemed before the year of jubilee (<r>Lev. 27:16-24</r>). Our Lord condemns the Pharisees for their false doctrine, inasmuch as by their traditions they had destroyed the commandment which requires children to honour their father and mother, teaching them to find excuse from helping their parents by the device of pronouncing 'Corban' over their goods, thus reserving them to their own selfish use."},
{i:959,k:"Cord",t:"frequently used in its proper sense, for fastening a tent (<r>Ex. 35:18; 39:40</r>), yoking animals to a cart (<r>Isa. 5:18</r>), binding prisoners (<r>Judg. 15:13; Ps. 2:3; 129:4</r>), and measuring ground (2 Sam. 8;2; Ps. 78:55). Figuratively, death is spoken of as the giving way of the tent-cord (<r>Job 4:21. 'Is not their tent-cord plucked up?' R.V.</r>). To gird one's self with a cord was a token of sorrow and humiliation. To stretch a line over a city meant to level it with the ground (<r>Lam. 2:8</r>). The 'cords of sin' are the consequences or fruits of sin (<r>Prov. 5:22</r>). A 'threefold cord' is a symbol of union (<r>Eccl. 4:12</r>). The 'cords of a man' (<r>Hos. 11:4</r>) means that men employ, in inducing each other, methods such as are suitable to men, and not 'cords' such as oxen are led by. Isaiah (5:18) says, 'Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope.' This verse is thus given in the Chaldee paraphrase: 'Woe to those who begin to sin by little and little, drawing sin by cords of vanity: these sins grow and increase till they are strong and are like a cart rope.' This may be the true meaning. The wicked at first draw sin with a slender cord; but by-and-by their sins increase, and they are drawn after them by a cart rope. Henderson in his commentary says: 'The meaning is that the persons described were not satisfied with ordinary modes of provoking the Deity, and the consequent ordinary approach of his vengeance, but, as it were, yoked themselves in the harness of iniquity, and, putting forth all their strength, drew down upon themselves, with accelerated speed, the load of punishment which their sins deserved.'"},
{i:960,k:"Coriander",t:"Heb. gad, (<r>Ex. 16:31; Num. 11:7</r>), seed to which the manna is likened in its form and colour. It is the Coriandrum sativum of botanists, an umbelliferous annual plant with a round stalk, about two feet high. It is widely cultivated in Eastern countries and in the south of Europe for the sake of its seeds, which are in the form of a little ball of the size of a peppercorn. They are used medicinally and as a spice. The Greek name of this plant is korion or koriannon, whence the name 'coriander.'"},
{i:961,k:"Corinth",t:"a Grecian city, on the isthmus which joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of Greece. It is about 48 miles west of Athens. The ancient city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and that mentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having been rebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a colony of freedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia (<r>Acts 18:12-16</r>). It was noted for its wealth, and for the luxurious and immoral and vicious habits of the people. It had a large mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews. When Paul first visited the city (A.D. 51 or 52), Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. Here Paul resided for eighteen months (18:1-18). Here he first became aquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after his departure Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval he visited it a second time, and remained for three months (20:3). During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans was written (probably A.D. 55). Although there were many Jewish converts at Corinth, yet the Gentile element prevailed in the church there."},
{i:962,k:"Corinthians, First Epistle to the",t:"was written from Ephesus (<r>1 Cor. 16:8</r>) about the time of the Passover in the third year of the apostle's sojourn there (<r>Acts 19:10; 20:31</r>), and when he had formed the purpose to visit Macedonia, and then return to Corinth (probably A.D. 57)."},
{i:963,k:"Corinthians, Second Epistle to the",t:"Shortly after writing his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul left Ephesus, where intense excitement had been aroused against him, the evidence of his great success, and proceeded to Macedonia. Pursuing the usual route, he reached Troas, the port of departure for Europe. Here he expected to meet with Titus, whom he had sent from Ephesus to Corinth, with tidings of the effects produced on the church there by the first epistle; but was disappointed (<r>1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 1:8; 2:12, 13</r>). He then left Troas and proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where he tarried, he was soon joined by Titus (<r>2 Cor. 7:6, 7</r>), who brought him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy. Under the influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the favourable report which Titus brought back from Corinth, this second epistle was written. It was probably written at Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica, early in the year A.D. 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus. This letter he addresses not only to the church in Corinth, but also to the saints in all Achaia, i.e., in Athens, Cenchrea, and other cities in Greece."},
{i:964,k:"Cormorant",t:"(<r>Lev. 11:17; Deut. 14:17</r>), Heb. shalak, 'plunging,' or 'darting down,' (the Phalacrocorax carbo), ranked among the 'unclean' birds; of the same family group as the pelican. It is a 'plunging' bird, and is common on the coasts and the island seas of Palestine. Some think the Hebrew word should be rendered 'gannet' (Sula bassana, 'the solan goose'); others that it is the 'tern' or 'sea swallow,' which also frequents the coasts of Palestine as well as the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan valley during several months of the year. But there is no reason to depart from the ordinary rendering."},
{i:965,k:"Corn",t:"The word so rendered (dagan) in Gen. 27:28, 37, Num. 18:27, Deut. 28:51, Lam. 2:12, is a general term representing all the commodities we usually describe by the words corn, grain, seeds, peas, beans. With this corresponds the use of the word in John 12:24."},
{i:966,k:"Cornelius",t:"a centurion whose history is narrated in Acts 10. He was a 'devout man,' and like the centurion of Capernaum, believed in the God of Israel. His residence at Caesrea probably brought him into contact with Jews who communicated to him their expectations regarding the Messiah; and thus he was prepared to welcome the message Peter brought him. He became the first fruit of the Gentile world to Christ. He and his family were baptized and admitted into the Christian church (<r>Acts 10:1, 44-48</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See CENTURION.</see>)"},
{i:967,k:"Corner",t:"The angle of a house (<r>Job 1:19</r>) or a street (<r>Prov. 7:8</r>). 'Corners' in Neh. 9:22 denotes the various districts of the promised land allotted to the Israelites. In Num. 24:17, the 'corners of Moab' denotes the whole land of Moab. The 'corner of a field' (<r>Lev. 19:9; 23:22</r>) is its extreme part, which was not to be reaped. The Jews were prohibited from cutting the 'corners,' i.e., the extremities, of the hair and whiskers running round the ears (<r>Lev. 19:27; 21:5</r>). The 'four corners of the earth' in Isa. 11:12 and Ezek. 7:2 denotes the whole land. The 'corners of the streets' mentioned in Matt. 6:5 means the angles where streets meet so as to form a square or place of public resort."},
{i:968,k:"Cornet",t:"Heb. shophar, 'brightness,' with reference to the clearness of its sound (<r>1 Chr. 15:28; 2 Chr. 15:14; Ps. 98:6; Hos. 5:8</r>). It is usually rendered in the Authorized Version 'trumpet.' It denotes the long and straight horn, about eighteen inches long. The words of Joel, 'Blow the trumpet,' literally, 'Sound the cornet,' refer to the festival which was the preparation for the day of Atonement. In Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15, the word (keren) so rendered is a curved horn. The word 'cornet' in 2 Sam. 6:5 (Heb. mena'an'im, occurring only here) was some kind of instrument played by being shaken like the Egyptian sistrum, consisting of rings or bells hung loosely on iron rods."},
{i:969,k:"Cotes",t:"pens or enclosures for flocks (<r>2 Chr. 32:28, 'cotes for flocks;' R.V., 'flocks in folds'</r>)."},
{i:970,k:"Cottage",t:"(1.) A booth in a vineyard (<r>Isa. 1:8</r>); a temporary shed covered with leaves or straw to shelter the watchman that kept the garden. These were slight fabrics, and were removed when no longer needed, or were left to be blown down in winter (<r>Job 27:18</r>)."},
{i:971,k:"Couch",t:"(<r>Gen. 49:4; 1 Chr. 5:1; Job 7:13; Ps. 6:6, etc.</r>), a seat for repose or rest. (<see target='x-self'>See BED.</see>)"},

{i:973,k:"Council",t:"spoken of counsellors who sat in public trials with the governor of a province (<r>Acts 25:12</r>)."},
{i:974,k:"Counsellor",t:"an adviser (<r>Prov. 11:14; 15:22</r>), a king's state counsellor (<r>2 Sam. 15:12</r>). Used once of the Messiah (<r>Isa. 9:6</r>). In Mark 15:43, Luke 23:50, the word probably means a member of the Jewish Sanhedrim."},
{i:975,k:"Courses",t:"When David was not permitted to build the temple, he proceeded, among the last acts of his life, with the assistance of Zadok and Ahimelech, to organize the priestly and musical services to be conducted in the house of God. (1.) He divided the priests into twenty-four courses (<r>1 Chr. 24:1-19</r>), sixteen being of the house of Eleazar and eight of that of Ithamar. Each course was under a head or chief, and ministered for a week, the order being determined by lot. (2.) The rest of the 38,000 Levites (23:4) were divided also into twenty-four courses, each to render some allotted service in public worship: 4,000 in twenty-four courses were set apart as singers and musicians under separate leaders (25); 4,000 as porters or keepers of the doors and gates of the sanctuary (26:1-19); and 6,000 as officers and judges to see to the administration of the law in all civil and ecclesiastical matters (20-32)."},
{i:976,k:"Court",t:"the enclosure of the tabernacle (<r>Ex. 27:9-19; 40:8</r>), of the temple (<r>1 Kings 6:36</r>), of a prison (<r>Neh. 3:25</r>), of a private house (<r>2 Sam. 17:18</r>), and of a king's palace (<r>2 Kings 20:4</r>)."},
{i:977,k:"Covenant",t:"a contract or agreement between two parties. In the Old Testament the Hebrew word _berith_ is always thus translated. _Berith_ is derived from a root which means 'to cut,' and hence a covenant is a 'cutting,' with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing between them, in making a covenant (Gen. 15; Jer. 34:18, 19)."},
{i:978,k:"Covering of the eyes",t:"occurs only in Gen. 20:16. In the Revised Version the rendering is 'it (i.e., Abimelech's present of 1,000 pieces of silver to Abraham) is for thee a covering of the eyes.' This has been regarded as an implied advice to Sarah to conform to the custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face."},
{i:979,k:"Covetousness",t:"a strong desire after the possession of worldly things (<r>Col. 3:5; Eph. 5:5; Heb. 13:5; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10; Matt. 6:20</r>). It assumes sometimes the more aggravated form of avarice, which is the mark of cold-hearted worldliness."},
{i:980,k:"Cow",t:"A cow and her calf were not to be killed on the same day (<r>Lev. 22:28; Ex. 23:19; Deut. 22:6, 7</r>). The reason for this enactment is not given. A state of great poverty is described in the words of Isa. 7:21-25, where, instead of possessing great resources, a man shall depend for the subsistence of himself and his family on what a single cow and two sheep could yield."},
{i:981,k:"Crane",t:"(<r>Isa. 38:14; Jer. 8:7</r>). In both of these passages the Authorized Version has reversed the Hebrew order of the words. 'Crane or swallow' should be 'swallow or crane,' as in the Revised Version. The rendering is there correct. The Hebrew for crane is _'agur_, the Grus cincerea, a bird well known in Palestine. It is migratory, and is distinguished by its loud voice, its cry being hoarse and melancholy."},
{i:982,k:"Creation",t:"'In the beginning' God created, i.e., called into being, all things out of nothing. This creative act on the part of God was absolutely free, and for infinitely wise reasons. The cause of all things exists only in the will of God. The work of creation is attributed (1) to the Godhead (<r>Gen. 1:1, 26</r>); (2) to the Father (<r>1 Cor. 8:6</r>); (3) to the Son (<r>John 1:3; Col. 1:16, 17</r>); (4) to the Holy Spirit (<r>Gen. 1:2; Job 26:13; Ps. 104:30</r>). The fact that he is the Creator distinguishes Jehovah as the true God (<r>Isa. 37:16; 40:12, 13; 54:5; Ps. 96:5; Jer. 10:11, 12</r>). The one great end in the work of creation is the manifestation of the glory of the Creator (<r>Col. 1:16; Rev. 4:11; Rom. 11:36</r>). God's works, equally with God's word, are a revelation from him; and between the teachings of the one and those of the other, when rightly understood, there can be no contradiction."},
{i:983,k:"Creature",t:"denotes the whole creation in Rom. 8:39; Col. 1:15; Rev. 5:13; the whole human race in Mark 16:15; Rom. 8:19-22."},
{i:984,k:"Crescens",t:"increasing, probably one of the seventy disciples of Christ. He was one of Paul's assistants (<r>2 Tim. 4:10</r>), probably a Christian of Rome."},
{i:985,k:"Crete",t:"now called Candia, one of the largest islands in the Meditterranean, about 140 miles long and 35 broad. It was at one time a very prosperous and populous island, having a 'hundred cities.' The character of the people is described in Paul's quotation from 'one of their own poets' (Epimenides) in his epistle to Titus: 'The Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies' (<r>Titus 1:12</r>). Jews from Crete were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (<r>Acts 2:11</r>). The island was visited by Paul on his voyage to Rome (Acts 27). Here Paul subsequently left Titus (1:5) 'to ordain elders.' Some have supposed that it was the original home of the Caphtorim (q.v.) or Philistines."},

{i:987,k:"Crisping-pin",t:"(<r>Isa. 3:22; R.V., 'satchel'</r>), some kind of female ornament, probably like the modern reticule. The Hebrew word _harit_ properly signifies pouch or casket or purse. It is rendered 'bag' in 2 Kings 5:23."},
{i:988,k:"Crispus",t:"curled, the chief of the synagogue at Corinth (<r>Acts 18:8</r>). He was converted and, with his family, baptized by Paul (<r>1 Cor. 1:14</r>)."},
{i:989,k:"Cross",t:"in the New Testament the instrument of crucifixion, and hence used for the crucifixion of Christ itself (<r>Eph. 2:16; Heb. 12:2; 1 Cor. 1:17, 18; Gal. 5:11; 6:12, 14; Phil. 3:18</r>). The word is also used to denote any severe affliction or trial (<r>Matt. 10:38; 16:24; Mark 8:34; 10:21</r>)."},
{i:990,k:"Crown",t:"(1.) Denotes the plate of gold in the front of the high priest's mitre (<r>Ex. 29:6; 39:30</r>). The same Hebrew word so rendered (ne'zer) denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle (<r>2 Sam. 1:10</r>), and also that which was used at the coronation of Joash (<r>2 Kings 11:12</r>)."},
{i:991,k:"Crown of thorns",t:"our Lord was crowned with a, in mockery by the Romans (<r>Matt. 27:29</r>). The object of Pilate's guard in doing this was probably to insult, and not specially to inflict pain. There is nothing to show that the shrub thus used was, as has been supposed, the spina Christi, which could have been easily woven into a wreath. It was probably the thorny nabk, which grew abundantly round about Jerusalem, and whose flexible, pliant, and round branches could easily be platted into the form of a crown. (<see target='x-self'>See THORN , 3.</see>)"},
{i:992,k:"Crucifixion",t:"a common mode of punishment among heathen nations in early times. It is not certain whether it was known among the ancient Jews; probably it was not. The modes of capital punishment according to the Mosaic law were, by the sword (Ex. 21), strangling, fire (Lev. 20), and stoning (Deut. 21)."},
{i:993,k:"Cruse",t:"a utensil; a flask or cup for holding water (<r>1 Sam. 26:11, 12, 16; 1 Kings 19:6</r>) or oil (<r>1 Kings 17:12, 14, 16</r>). In 1 Kings 14:3 the word there so rendered means properly a bottle, as in Jer. 19:1, 10, or pitcher. In 2 Kings 2:20, a platter or flat metal saucer is intended. The Hebrew word here used is translated 'dish' in 21:13; 'pans,' in 2 Chr. 35:13; and 'bosom,' in Prov. 19:24; 26:15 (R.V., 'dish')."},
{i:994,k:"Crystal",t:"(<r>Ezek. 1:22, with the epithet 'terrible,' as dazzling the spectators with its brightness</r>). The word occurs in Rev. 4:6; 21:11; 22:1. It is a stone of the flint order, the most refined kind of quartz. The Greek word here used means also literally 'ice.' The ancients regarded the crystal as only pure water congealed into extreme hardness by great length of time."},
{i:995,k:"Cubit",t:"Heb. 'ammah; i.e., 'mother of the arm,' the fore-arm, is a word derived from the Latin cubitus, the lower arm. It is difficult to determine the exact length of this measure, from the uncertainty whether it included the entire length from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger, or only from the elbow to the root of the hand at the wrist. The probability is that the longer was the original cubit. The common computation as to the length of the cubit makes it 20.24 inches for the ordinary cubit, and 21.888 inches for the sacred one. This is the same as the Egyptian measurements."},
{i:996,k:"Cuckoo",t:"(Heb. shahaph), from a root meaning 'to be lean; slender.' This bird is mentioned only in Lev. 11:16 and Deut. 14:15 (R.V., 'seamew'). Some have interpreted the Hebrew word by 'petrel' or 'shearwater' (Puffinus cinereus), which is found on the coast of Syria; others think it denotes the 'sea-gull' or 'seamew.' The common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) feeds on reptiles and large insects. It is found in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. It only passes the winter in Palestine. The Arabs suppose it to utter the cry _Yakub_, and hence they call it _tir el-Yakub_; i.e., 'Jacob's bird.'"},
{i:997,k:"Cucumbers",t:"(Heb. plur. kishshuim; i.e., 'hard,' 'difficult' of digestion, only in Num. 11:5). This vegetable is extensively cultivated in the East at the present day, as it appears to have been in earlier times among the Hebrews. It belongs to the gourd family of plants. In the East its cooling pulp and juice are most refreshing. 'We need not altogether wonder that the Israelites, wearily marching through the arid solitudes of the Sinaitic peninsula, thought more of the cucumbers and watermelons of which they had had no lack in Egypt, rather than of the cruel bondage which was the price of these luxuries.' Groser's Scripture Natural History."},
{i:998,k:"Cummin",t:"(Heb. kammon; i.e., a 'condiment'), the fruit or seed of an umbelliferous plant, the Cuminum sativum, still extensively cultivated in the East. Its fruit is mentioned in Isa. 28:25, 27. In the New Testament it is mentioned in Matt. 23:23, where our Lord pronounces a 'woe' on the scribes and Pharisees, who were zealous in paying tithes of 'mint and anise and cummin,' while they omitted the weightier matters of the law.' 'It is used as a spice, both bruised, to mix with bread, and also boiled, in the various messes and stews which compose an Oriental banquet.' Tristram, Natural History."},
{i:999,k:"Cup",t:"a wine-cup (<r>Gen. 40:11, 21</r>), various forms of which are found on Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. All Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold (<r>1 Kings 10: 21</r>). The cups mentioned in the New Testament were made after Roman and Greek models, and were sometimes of gold (<r>Rev. 17:4</r>)."},
{i:1000,k:"Cup-bearer",t:"an officer of high rank with Egyptian, Persian, Assyrian, and Jewish monarchs. The cup-bearer of the king of Egypt is mentioned in connection with Joseph's history (<r>Gen. 40:1-21; 41:9</r>). Rabshakeh (q.v.) was cup-bearer in the Assyrian court (<r>2 Kings 18:17</r>). Nehemiah filled this office to the king of Persia (<r>Neh. 1:11</r>). We read also of Solomon's cup-bearers (<r>1 Kings 10:5; 2 Chr. 9:4</r>)."},
{i:1001,k:"Curious arts",t:"(<r>Acts 19:19</r>), magical arts; jugglery practised by the Ephesian conjurers. Ephesus was noted for its wizard and the 'Ephesian spells;' i.e., charms or scraps of parchment written over with certain formula, which were worn as a safeguard against all manner of evils. The more important and powerful of these charms were written out in books which circulated among the exorcists, and were sold at a great price."},
{i:1002,k:"Curse",t:"denounced by God against the serpent (<r>Gen. 3:14</r>), and against Cain (4:11). These divine maledictions carried their effect with them. Prophetical curses were sometimes pronounced by holy men (<r>Gen. 9:25; 49:7; Deut. 27:15; Josh. 6:26</r>). Such curses are not the consequence of passion or revenge, they are predictions."},
{i:1003,k:"Curtain",t:"(1.) Ten curtains, each twenty-eight cubits long and four wide, made of fine linen, also eleven made of goat's hair, covered the tabernacle (<r>Ex. 26:1-13; 36:8-17</r>)."},
{i:1004,k:"Cush",t:"black. (1.) A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod (<r>Gen. 10:8; 1 Chr. 1:10</r>). From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush (<r>Gen. 2:13, R.V.</r>). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt (<r>Ezek. 29:10, A.V. 'Ethiopia,' Heb. Cush</r>), with which it is generally associated (<r>Ps. 68:31; Isa. 18:1; Jer. 46:9, etc.</r>). It stands also associated with Elam (<r>Isa. 11:11</r>), with Persia (<r>Ezek. 38:5</r>), and with the Sabeans (<r>Isa. 45:14</r>). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia (<r>Isa. 18:1; Zeph. 3:10, Heb. Cush</r>). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed _Kesh_. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites 'from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.' The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation."},
{i:1005,k:"Cushan",t:"probably a poetic or prolonged name of the land of Cush, the Arabian Cush (<r>Hab. 3:7</r>). Some have, however, supposed this to be the same as Chushan-rishathaim (<r>Judg. 3:8, 10</r>), i.e., taking the latter part of the name as a title or local appellation, Chushan 'of the two iniquities' (= oppressing Israel, and provoking them to idolatry), a Mesopotamian king, identified by Rawlinson with Asshur-ris-ilim (the father of Tiglathpileser I.); but incorrectly, for the empire of Assyria was not yet founded. He held Israel in bondage for eight years."},
{i:1006,k:"Cushite",t:"(1.) The messenger sent by Joab to David to announce his victory over Absalom (<r>2 Sam. 18:32</r>)."},
{i:1007,k:"Custom",t:"a tax imposed by the Romans. The tax-gatherers were termed publicans (q.v.), who had their stations at the gates of cities, and in the public highways, and at the place set apart for that purpose, called the 'receipt of custom' (<r>Matt.9: 9; Mark 2:14</r>), where they collected the money that was to be paid on certain goods (<r>Matt.17:25</r>). These publicans were tempted to exact more from the people than was lawful, and were, in consequence of their extortions, objects of great hatred. The Pharisees would have no intercourse with them (<r>Matt.5:46, 47; 9:10, 11</r>)."},
{i:1008,k:"Cuthah",t:"one of the Babylonian cities or districts from which Shalmaneser transplanted certain colonists to Samaria (<r>2 Kings 17:24</r>). Some have conjectured that the 'Cutheans' were identical with the 'Cossaeans' who inhabited the hill-country to the north of the river Choaspes. Cuthah is now identified with Tell Ibrahim, 15 miles north-east of Babylon."},
{i:1009,k:"Cutting",t:"the flesh in various ways was an idolatrous practice, a part of idol-worship (<r>Deut. 14:1; 1 Kings 18:28</r>). The Israelites were commanded not to imitate this practice (<r>Lev. 19:28; 21:5; Deut. 14:1</r>). The tearing of the flesh from grief and anguish of spirit in mourning for the dead was regarded as a mark of affection (<r>Jer. 16:6; 41:5; 48:37</r>)."},
{i:1010,k:"Cymbals",t:"(Heb. tzeltzelim, from a root meaning to 'tinkle'), musical instruments, consisting of two convex pieces of brass one held in each hand, which were clashed together to produce a loud clanging sound; castanets; 'loud cymbals.' 'Highsounding cymbals' consisted of two larger plates, one held also in each hand (<r>2 Sam. 6:5; Ps. 150:5; 1 Chr. 13:8; 15:16, 19, 28; 1 Cor. 13:1</r>)."},
{i:1011,k:"Cypress",t:"(Heb. tirzah, 'hardness'), mentioned only in Isa. 44:14 (R.V., 'holm tree'). The oldest Latin version translates this word by ilex, i.e., the evergreen oak, which may possibly have been the tree intended; but there is great probability that our Authorized Version is correct in rendering it 'cypress.' This tree grows abundantly on the mountains of Hermon. Its wood is hard and fragrant, and very durable. Its foliage is dark and gloomy. It is an evergreen (Cupressus sempervirens). 'Throughout the East it is used as a funereal tree; and its dark, tall, waving plumes render it peculiarly appropriate among the tombs.'"},
{i:1012,k:"Cyprus",t:"one of the largest islands of the Mediterranean, about 148 miles long and 40 broad. It is distant about 60 miles from the Syrian coast. It was the 'Chittim' of the Old Testament (<r>Num. 24:24</r>). The Greek colonists gave it the name of Kypros, from the cyprus, i.e., the henna (<see target='x-self'>see CAMPHIRE</see>), which grew on this island. It was originally inhabited by Phoenicians. In B.C. 477 it fell under the dominion of the Greeks; and became a Roman province B.C. 58. In ancient times it was a centre of great commercial activity. Corn and wine and oil were produced here in the greatest perfection. It was rich also in timber and in mineral wealth."},
{i:1013,k:"Cyrene",t:"a city (now Tripoli) in Upper Libya, North Africa, founded by a colony of Greeks (B.C. 630). It contained latterly a large number of Jews, who were introduced into the city by Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, because he thought they would contribute to the security of the place. They increased in number and influence; and we are thus prepared for the frequent references to them in connection with the early history of Christianity. Simon, who bore our Lord's cross, was a native of this place (<r>Matt. 27:32; Mark 15:21</r>). Jews from Cyrene were in Jerusalem at Pentecost (<r>Acts 2:10</r>); and Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue at Jerusalem (6:9). Converts belonging to Cyrene contributed to the formation of the first Gentile church at Antioch (11:20). Among 'the prophets and teachers' who 'ministered to the Lord at Antioch' was Lucius of Cyrene (13:1)."},
{i:1014,k:"Cyrenius",t:"the Grecized form of Quirinus. His full name was Publius Sulpicius Quirinus. Recent historical investigation has proved that Quirinus was governor of Cilicia, which was annexed to Syria at the time of our Lord's birth. Cilicia, which he ruled, being a province of Syria, he is called the governor, which he was de jure, of Syria. Some ten years afterwards he was appointed governor of Syria for the second time. During his tenure of office, at the time of our Lord's birth (<r>Luke 2:2</r>), a 'taxing' (R.V., 'enrolment;' i.e., a registration) of the people was 'first made;' i.e., was made for the first time under his government. (<see target='x-self'>See TAXING.</see>)"},
{i:1015,k:"Cyrus",t:"(Heb. Ko'resh), the celebrated 'King of Persia' (Elam) who was conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of liberation to the Jews (<r>Ezra 1:1, 2</r>). He was the son of Cambyses, the prince of Persia, and was born about B.C. 599. In the year B.C. 559 he became king of Persia, the kingdom of Media being added to it partly by conquest. Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar's feast (<r>Dan. 5:30</r>), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf., 'Go up, O Elam', Isa.21:2)."},
{i:1016,k:"Daberath",t:"pasture, a Levitical town of Issachar (<r>Josh. 19:12; 21:28</r>), near the border of Zebulum. It is the modern small village of Deburich, at the base of Mount Tabor. Tradition has incorrectly made it the scene of the miracle of the cure of the lunatic child (<r>Matt. 17:14</r>)."},
{i:1017,k:"Daemon",t:"the Greek form, rendered 'devil' in the Authorized Version of the New Testament. Daemons are spoken of as spiritual beings (<r>Matt. 8:16; 10:1; 12:43-45</r>) at enmity with God, and as having a certain power over man (<r>James 2:19; Rev. 16:14</r>). They recognize our Lord as the Son of God (<r>Matt. 8:20; Luke 4:41</r>). They belong to the number of those angels that 'kept not their first estate,' 'unclean spirits,' 'fallen angels,' the angels of the devil (<r>Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7-9</r>). They are the 'principalities and powers' against which we must 'wrestle' (<r>Eph. 6:12</r>)."},
{i:1018,k:"Daemoniac",t:"one 'possessed with a devil.' In the days of our Lord and his apostles, evil spirits, 'daemons,' were mysteriously permitted by God to exercise an influence both over the souls and bodies of men, inflicting dumbness (<r>Matt. 9:32</r>), blindness (12:22), epilepsy (<r>Mark 9:17-27</r>), insanity (<r>Matt. 8:28; Mark 5:1-5</r>). Daemoniacs are frequently distinguished from those who are afflicted with ordinary bodily maladies (<r>Mark 1:32; 16:17, 18; Luke 6:17, 18</r>). The daemons speak in their own persons (<r>Matt. 8:29; Mark 1:23, 24; 5:7</r>). This influence is clearly distinguished from the ordinary power of corruption and of temptation over men. In the daemoniac his personality seems to be destroyed, and his actions, words, and even thoughts to be overborne by the evil spirit (Mark, l.c.; Acts 19:15)."},
{i:1019,k:"Dagon",t:"little fish; diminutive from dag = a fish, the fish-god; the national god of the Philistines (<r>Judg. 16:23</r>). This idol had the body of a fish with the head and hands of a man. It was an Assyrio-Babylonian deity, the worship of which was introduced among the Philistines through Chaldea. The most famous of the temples of Dagon were at Gaza (<r>Judg. 16:23-30</r>) and Ashdod (<r>1 Sam. 5:1-7</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See FISH.</see>)"},
{i:1020,k:"Dagon's house",t:"(<r>1 Sam. 5:2</r>), or Beth-dagon, as elsewhere rendered (<r>Josh.15: 41; 19:27</r>), was the sanctuary or temple of Dagon."},
{i:1021,k:"Daily sacrifice",t:"(<r>Dan. 8:12; 11:31; 12:11</r>), a burnt offering of two lambs of a year old, which were daily sacrificed in the name of the whole Israelitish people upon the great altar, the first at dawn of day, and the second at evening (<r>Dan. 9:21</r>), or more correctly, 'between the two evenings.' (<see target='x-self'>See SACRIFICE.</see>)"},
{i:1022,k:"Dale, the king's",t:"the name of a valley, the alternative for 'the valley of Shaveh' (q.v.), near the Dead Sea, where the king of Sodom met Abraham (<r>Gen. 14:17</r>). Some have identified it with the southern part of the valley of Jehoshaphat, where Absalom reared his family monument (<r>2 Sam. 18:18</r>)."},
{i:1023,k:"Dalmanutha",t:"a place on the west of the Sea of Galilee, mentioned only in Mark 8:10. In the parallel passage it is said that Christ came 'into the borders of Magdala' (<r>Matt. 15:39</r>). It is plain, then, that Dalmanutha was near Magdala, which was probably the Greek name of one of the many Migdols (i.e., watch-towers) on the western side of the lake of Gennesaret. It has been identified in the ruins of a village about a mile from Magdala, in the little open valley of 'Ain-el-Barideh, 'the cold fountain,' called el-Mejdel, possibly the 'Migdal-el' of Josh. 19:38."},
{i:1024,k:"Dalmatia",t:"a mountainous country on the eastern shore of the Adriatic, a part of the Roman province of Illyricum. It still bears its ancient name. During Paul's second imprisonment at Rome, Titus left him to visit Dalmatia (<r>2 Tim. 4:10</r>) for some unknown purpose. Paul had himself formerly preached in that region (<r>Rom. 15:19</r>)."},
{i:1025,k:"Damaris",t:"a heifer, an Athenian woman converted to Christianity under the preaching of Paul (<r>Acts 17:34</r>). Some have supposed that she may have been the wife of Dionysius the Areopagite."},
{i:1026,k:"Damascus",t:"activity, the most ancient of Oriental cities; the capital of Syria (<r>Isa. 7:8; 17:3</r>); situated about 133 miles to the north of Jerusalem. Its modern name is Esh-Sham; i.e., 'the East.'"},
{i:1027,k:"Damnation",t:"in Rom. 13:2, means 'condemnation,' which comes on those who withstand God's ordinance of magistracy. This sentence of condemnation comes not from the magistrate, but from God, whose authority is thus resisted."},
{i:1028,k:"Dan",t:"a judge. (1.) The fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel's maid (<r>Gen. 30:6, 'God hath judged me', Heb. dananni</r>). The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, 'Dan shall judge his people' (49:16), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan."},
{i:1029,k:"Dan-jaan",t:"woodland Dan, a place probably somewhere in the direction of Dan, near the sources of the Jordan (<r>2 Sam. 24:6</r>). The LXX. and the Vulgate read 'Dan-ja'ar', i.e., 'Dan in the forest.'"},
{i:1030,k:"Dance",t:"found in Judg. 21:21, 23; Ps. 30:11; 149:3; 150:4; Jer. 31:4, 13, etc., as the translation of _hul_, which points to the whirling motion of Oriental sacred dances. It is the rendering of a word (rakad') which means to skip or leap for joy, in Eccl. 3:4; Job 21:11; Isa. 13:21, etc."},
{i:1031,k:"Daniel",t:"God is my judge, or judge of God. (1.) David's second son, 'born unto him in Hebron, of Abigail the Carmelitess' (<r>1 Chr. 3:1</r>). He is called also Chileab (<r>2 Sam. 3:3</r>)."},

{i:1036,k:"Dinah",t:"judged; vindicated, daughter of Jacob by Leah, and sister of Simeon and Levi (<r>Gen. 30:21</r>). She was seduced by Shechem, the son of Hamor, the Hivite chief, when Jacob's camp was in the neighbourhood of Shechem. This led to the terrible revenge of Simeon and Levi in putting the Shechemites to death (Gen. 34). Jacob makes frequent reference to this deed of blood with abhorrence and regret (<r>Gen. 34:30; 49:5-7</r>). She is mentioned among the rest of Jacob's family that went down into Egypt (<r>Gen. 46:8, 15</r>)."},
{i:1037,k:"Dine",t:"(<r>Gen. 43:16</r>). It was the custom in Egypt to dine at noon. But it is probable that the Egyptians took their principal meal in the evening, as was the general custom in the East (<r>Luke 14:12</r>)."},
{i:1038,k:"Dinhabah",t:"robbers' den, an Edomitish city, the capital of king Bela (<r>Gen. 36:32</r>). It is probably the modern Dibdiba, a little north-east of Petra."},

{i:1041,k:"Disciple",t:"a scholar, sometimes applied to the followers of John the Baptist (<r>Matt. 9:14</r>), and of the Pharisees (22:16), but principally to the followers of Christ. A disciple of Christ is one who (1) believes his doctrine, (2) rests on his sacrifice, (3) imbibes his spirit, and (4) imitates his example (<r>Matt. 10:24; Luke 14:26, 27, 33; John 6:69</r>)."},
{i:1042,k:"Dish",t:"for eating from (<r>2 Kings 21:13</r>). Judas dipped his hand with a 'sop' or piece of bread in the same dish with our Lord, thereby indicating friendly intimacy (<r>Matt. 26:23</r>). The 'lordly dish' in Judg. 5:25 was probably the shallow drinking cup, usually of brass. In Judg. 6:38 the same Hebrew word is rendered 'bowl.'"},
{i:1043,k:"Dishan",t:"antelope, the youngest son of Seir the Horite, head of one of the tribes of Idumaea (<r>Gen. 36:21, 28, 30</r>)."},
{i:1044,k:"Dispensation",t:"(Gr. oikonomia, 'management,' 'economy'). (1.) The method or scheme according to which God carries out his purposes towards men is called a dispensation. There are usually reckoned three dispensations, the Patriarchal, the Mosaic or Jewish, and the Christian. (<see target='x-self'>See COVENANT, Administration of.</see>) These were so many stages in God's unfolding of his purpose of grace toward men. The word is not found with this meaning in Scripture."},
{i:1045,k:"Dispersion",t:"(Gr. diaspora, 'scattered,' James 1:1; 1 Pet. 1:1) of the Jews. At various times, and from the operation of divers causes, the Jews were separated and scattered into foreign countries 'to the outmost parts of heaven' (<r>Deut. 30:4</r>)."},

{i:1047,k:"Divination",t:"of false prophets (<r>Deut. 18:10, 14; Micah 3:6, 7, 11</r>), of necromancers (<r>1 Sam. 28:8</r>), of the Philistine priests and diviners (<r>1 Sam. 6:2</r>), of Balaam (<r>Josh. 13:22</r>). Three kinds of divination are mentioned in Ezek. 21:21, by arrows, consulting with images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines (<r>Isa. 2:6; 1 Sam. 28</r>). At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued their occupations (<r>Isa. 8:19; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chr. 33:6</r>). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostles there were 'vagabond Jews, exorcists' (<r>Acts 19:13</r>), and men like Simon Magus (<r>Acts 8:9</r>), Bar-jesus (13:6, 8), and other jugglers and impostors (19:19; 2 Tim. 3:13). Every species and degree of this superstition was strictly forbidden by the law of Moses (<r>Ex. 22:18; Lev. 19:26, 31; 20:27; Deut. 18:10, 11</r>)."},
{i:1048,k:"Divorce",t:"The dissolution of the marriage tie was regulated by the Mosaic law (<r>Deut. 24:1-4</r>). The Jews, after the Captivity, were reguired to dismiss the foreign women they had married contrary to the law (<r>Ezra 10:11-19</r>). Christ limited the permission of divorce to the single case of adultery. It seems that it was not uncommon for the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slight pretences (<r>Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:1-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18</r>). These precepts given by Christ regulate the law of divorce in the Christian Church."},

Their disciples were allowed to propose to them questions. They assumed the office without any appointment to it. The doctors of the law were principally of the sect of the Pharisees. Schools were established after the destruction of Jerusalem at Babylon and Tiberias, in which academical degrees were conferred on those who passed a certain examination. Those of the school of Tiberias were called by the title 'rabbi,' and those of Babylon by that of 'master.'"},

It was one of Solomon's commissariat districts (<r>Judg. 1:27; 1 Kings 4:11</r>). It has been identified with Tantura (so named from the supposed resemblance of its tower to a tantur, i.e., 'a horn'). This tower fell in 1895, and nothing remains but debris and foundation walls, the remains of an old Crusading fortress.

Doves and turtle-doves were the only birds that could be offered in sacrifice, as they were clean according to the Mosaic law (<r>Ge. 15:9; Lev. 5:7; 12:6; Luke 2:24</r>). The dove was the harbinger of peace to Noah (<r>Gen. 8:8, 10</r>). It is often mentioned as the emblem of purity (<r>Ps. 68:13</r>). It is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (<r>Gen. 1:2; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32</r>); also of tender and devoted affection (<r>Cant. 1:15; 2:14</r>). David in his distress wished that he had the wings of a dove, that he might fly away and be at rest (<r>Ps. 55:6-8</r>).

This name, however, is applied by the Arabs to different vegetable substances, and there is room for the opinion of those who think that some such substance is here referred to, as, e.g., the seeds of a kind of millet, or a very inferior kind of pulse, or the root of the ornithogalum, i.e., bird-milk, the star-of-Bethlehem."},

The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth (<r>Ex. 26:7; 35:6</r>), which formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist's robe (<r>Matt. 3:4</r>). Wool was also woven into garments (<r>Lev. 13:47; Deut. 22:11; Ezek. 34:3; Job 31:20; Prov. 27:26</r>).

One-fourth of an hin of wine was required for one lamb, one-third for a ram, and one-half for a bullock (<r>Num. 15:5; 28:7, 14</r>). 'Drink offerings of blood' (<r>Ps. 16:4</r>) is used in allusion to the heathen practice of mingling the blood of animals sacrificed with wine or water, and pouring out the mixture in the worship of the gods, and the idea conveyed is that the psalmist would not partake of the abominations of the heathen."},

He is said to have been also a priest of Astarte, whose worship was closely allied to that of Baal, and this may account for his daughter's zeal in promoting idolatry in Israel.

It corresponds generally with what is now known as the Soudan (i.e., the land of the blacks). This country was known to the Hebrews, and is described in Isa. 18:1; Zeph. 3:10.

The law of Moses excluded them from the congregation (<r>Deut. 23:1</r>). They were common also among the Greeks and Romans. It is said that even to-day there are some in Rome who are employed in singing soprano in the Sistine Chapel. Three classes of eunuchs are mentioned in Matt. 19:12."},
{i:1091,k:"Euodias",t:"a good journey, a female member of the church at Philippi. She was one who laboured much with Paul in the gospel. He exhorts her to be of one mind with Syntyche (<r>Phil. 4:2</r>). From this it seems they had been at variance with each other."},
{i:1092,k:"Euphrates",t:"Hebrew, Perath; Assyrian, Purat; Persian cuneiform, Ufratush, whence Greek Euphrates, meaning 'sweet water.' The Assyrian name means 'the stream,' or 'the great stream.'

{i:1095,k:"Evangelist",t:"a 'publisher of glad tidings;' a missionary preacher of the gospel (<r>Eph. 4:11</r>). This title is applied to Philip (<r>Acts 21:8</r>), who appears to have gone from city to city preaching the word (8:4, 40). Judging from the case of Philip, evangelists had neither the authority of an apostle, nor the gift of prophecy, nor the responsibility of pastoral supervision over a portion of the flock. They were itinerant preachers, having it as their special function to carry the gospel to places where it was previously unknown. The writers of the four Gospels are known as the Evangelists."},

The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy. The commentator Matthew Henry says: 'This companion was taken from his side to signify that she was to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of equality which is to subsist in the marriage state.' And again, 'That wife that is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a helpmeet to her husband.' Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also unto her husband (<r>1 Tim. 2:13-15; 2 Cor. 11:3</r>). When she gave birth to her first son, she said, 'I have gotten a man from the Lord' (R.V., 'I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord,' Gen. 4:1). Thus she welcomed Cain, as some think, as if he had been the Promised One the 'Seed of the woman.'"},
{i:1097,k:"Evening",t:"the period following sunset with which the Jewish day began (<r>Gen. 1:5; Mark 13:35</r>). The Hebrews reckoned two evenings of each day, as appears from Ex. 16:12: 30:8; 12:6 (marg.); Lev. 23:5 (marg. R.V., 'between the two evenings'). The 'first evening' was that period when the sun was verging towards setting, and the 'second evening' the moment of actual sunset. The word 'evenings' in Jer. 5:6 should be 'deserts' (marg.

Influenced probably by Daniel, he showed kindness to Jehoiachin, who had been a prisoner in Babylon for thirty-seven years. He released him, and 'spoke kindly to him.'

{i:1103,k:"Executioner",t:"(<r>Mark 6:27</r>). Instead of the Greek word, Mark here uses a Latin word, speculator, which literally means 'a scout,' 'a spy,' and at length came to denote one of the armed bodyguard of the emperor.

Other references to exorcism as practised by the Jews are found in Matt. 12:27; Mark 9:38; Luke 9:49, 50.

Some interpreters, however, regard the name as designating the bubale, Antelope bubale, the 'wild cow' of North Africa, which is about the size of a stag, like the hartebeest of South Africa. A species of deer has been found at Mount Carmel which is called _yahmur_ by the Arabs. It is said to be similar to the European roebuck."},
{i:1129,k:"Fallow-ground",t:"The expression, 'Break up your fallow ground' (<r>Hos. 10:12; Jer. 4:3</r>) means, 'Do not sow your seed among thorns', i.e., break off all your evil habits; clear your hearts of weeds, in order that they may be prepared for the seed of righteousness. Land was allowed to lie fallow that it might become more fruitful; but when in this condition, it soon became overgrown with thorns and weeds. The cultivator of the soil was careful to 'break up' his fallow ground, i.e., to clear the field of weeds, before sowing seed in it. So says the prophet, 'Break off your evil ways, repent of your sins, cease to do evil, and then the good seed of the word will have room to grow and bear fruit.'"},
{i:1130,k:"Familiar spirit",t:"Sorcerers or necormancers, who professed to call up the dead to answer questions, were said to have a 'familiar spirit' (<r>Deut. 18:11; 2 Kings 21:6; 2 Chr. 33:6; Lev. 19:31; 20:6; Isa. 8:19; 29:4</r>). Such a person was called by the Hebrews an _'ob_, which properly means a leathern bottle; for sorcerers were regarded as vessels containing the inspiring demon. This Hebrew word was equivalent to the pytho of the Greeks, and was used to denote both the person and the spirit which possessed him (<r>Lev. 20:27; 1 Sam. 28:8; comp. Acts 16:16</r>). The word 'familiar' is from the Latin familiaris, meaning a 'household servant,' and was intended to express the idea that sorcerers had spirits as their servants ready to obey their commands."},
{i:1131,k:"Famine",t:"The first mentioned in Scripture was so grievous as to compel Abraham to go down to the land of Egypt (<r>Gen. 26:1</r>). Another is mentioned as having occurred in the days of Isaac, causing him to go to Gerar (<r>Gen. 26:1, 17</r>). But the most remarkable of all was that which arose in Egypt in the days of Joseph, which lasted for seven years (Gen. 41-45)."},
{i:1132,k:"Fan",t:"a winnowing shovel by which grain was thrown up against the wind that it might be cleansed from broken straw and chaff (<r>Isa. 30:24; Jer. 15:7; Matt. 3:12</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See AGRICULTURE.</see>)"},
{i:1133,k:"Farm",t:"(<r>Matt. 22:5</r>). Every Hebrew had a certain portion of land assigned to him as a possession (<r>Num. 26:33-56</r>). In Egypt the lands all belonged to the king, and the husbandmen were obliged to give him a fifth part of the produce; so in Palestine Jehovah was the sole possessor of the soil, and the people held it by direct tenure from him. By the enactment of Moses, the Hebrews paid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was assigned to the priesthood. Military service when required was also to be rendered by every Hebrew at his own expense. The occuptaion of a husbandman was held in high honour (<r>1 Sam. 11:5-7; 1 Kings 19:19; 2 Chr. 26:10</r>).

{i:1135,k:"Fast",t:"The sole fast required by the law of Moses was that of the great Day of Atonement (q.v.), Lev. 23:26-32. It is called 'the fast' (<r>Acts 27:9</r>)."},
{i:1136,k:"Fat",t:"(Heb. heleb) denotes the richest part of the animal, or the fattest of the flock, in the account of Abel's sacrifice (<r>Gen. 4:4</r>). It sometimes denotes the best of any production (<r>Gen. 45:18; Num. 18:12; Ps. 81:16; 147:47</r>). The fat of sacrifices was to be burned (<r>Lev. 3:9-11; 4:8; 7:3; 8:25; Num. 18:17. Comp.

Matt. 22:4, where the word used in the original, sitistos, means literally 'corn-fed;' i.e., installed, fat</r>). (2.) Ps. 66:15 (Heb. meah, meaning 'marrowy,' 'fat,' a species of sheep). (3.) 1 Sam. 15:9 (Heb. mishneh, meaning 'the second,' and hence probably 'cattle of a second quality,' or lambs of the second birth, i.e., autmnal lambs, and therfore of less value)."},
{i:1140,k:"Fear of the Lord the",t:"is in the Old Testament used as a designation of true piety (<r>Prov. 1:7; Job 28:28; Ps. 19:9</r>). It is a fear conjoined with love and hope, and is therefore not a slavish dread, but rather filial reverence. (<r>Comp. Deut. 32:6; Hos. 11:1; Isa. 1:2; 63:16; 64:8.</r>) God is called 'the Fear of Isaac' (<r>Gen. 31:42, 53</r>), i.e., the God whom Isaac feared."},

{i:1142,k:"Felix",t:"happy, the Roman procurator of Judea before whom Paul 'reasoned' (<r>Acts 24:25</r>). He appears to have expected a bribe from Paul, and therefore had several interviews with him. The 'worthy deeds' referred to in 24:2 was his clearing the country of banditti and impostors."},

With God, consisting in the knowledge of his will (<r>Job 22:21; John 17:3</r>); agreement with his designs (<r>Amos 3:2</r>); mutual affection (<r>Rom. 8: 38, 39</r>); enjoyment of his presence (<r>Ps. 4:6</r>); conformity to his image (<r>1 John 2:6; 1:6</r>); and participation of his felicity (<r>1 John 1:3, 4; Eph. 3:14-21</r>)."},
{i:1144,k:"Fence",t:"(Heb. gader), Num. 22:24 (R.V.). Fences were constructions of unmortared stones, to protect gardens, vineyards, sheepfolds, etc. From various causes they were apt to bulge out and fall (<r>Ps. 62:3</r>). In Ps. 80:12, R.V. (<r>see Isa. 5:5</r>), the psalmist says, 'Why hast thou broken down her fences?' Serpents delight to lurk in the crevices of such fences (<r>Eccl. 10:8; comp. Amos 5:19</r>)."},
{i:1145,k:"Fenced cities",t:"There were in Palestine (1) cities, (2) unwalled villages, and (3) villages with castles or towers (<r>1 Chr. 27:25</r>). Cities, so called, had walls, and were thus fenced. The fortifications consisted of one or two walls, on which were towers or parapets at regular intervals (<r>2 Chr. 32:5; Jer. 31:38</r>). Around ancient Jerusalem were three walls, on one of which were ninety towers, on the second fourteen, and on the third sixty. The tower of Hananeel, near the north-east corner of the city wall, is frequently referred to (<r>Neh. 3:1; 12:39; Zech. 14:10</r>). The gateways of such cities were also fortified (<r>Neh. 2:8; 3:3, 6; Judg. 16:2, 3; 1 Sam. 23:7</r>)."},
{i:1146,k:"Ferret",t:"Lev. 11:30 (R.V., 'gecko'), one of the unclean creeping things. It was perhaps the Lacerta gecko which was intended by the Hebrew word (anakah, a cry, 'mourning,' the creature which groans) here used, i.e., the 'fan-footed' lizard, the gecko which makes a mournful wail. The LXX. translate it by a word meaning 'shrew-mouse,' of which there are three species in Palestine. The Rabbinical writers regard it as the hedgehog. The translation of the Revised Version is to be preferred."},
{i:1147,k:"Ferry boat",t:"(<r>2 Sam. 19:18</r>), some kind of boat for crossing the river which the men of Judah placed at the service of the king. Floats or rafts for this purpose were in use from remote times (<r>Isa. 18:2</r>)."},

A few weeks after he had entered on his office the case of Paul, then a prisoner at Caesarea, was reported to him. The 'next day,' after he had gone down to Caesarea, he heard Paul defend himself in the presence of Herod Agrippa II. and his sister Bernice, and not finding in him anything worthy of death or of bonds, would have set him free had he not appealed unto Caesar (<r>Acts 25:11, 12</r>). In consequence of this appeal Paul was sent to Rome. Festus, after being in office less than two years, died in Judea. (<see target='x-self'>See AGRIPPA.</see>)"},
{i:1150,k:"Fever",t:"(<r>Deut. 28:22; Matt. 8:14; Mark 1:30; John 4:52; Acts 28:8</r>), a burning heat, as the word so rendered denotes, which attends all febrile attacks. In all Eastern countries such diseases are very common. Peter's wife's mother is said to have suffered from a 'great fever' (<r>Luke 4:38</r>), an instance of Luke's professional exactitude in describing disease. He adopts here the technical medical distinction, as in those times fevers were divided into the 'great' and the 'less.'"},
{i:1151,k:"Field",t:"(Heb. sadeh), a cultivated field, but unenclosed. It is applied to any cultivated ground or pasture (<r>Gen. 29:2; 31:4; 34:7</r>), or tillage (<r>Gen. 37:7; 47:24</r>). It is also applied to woodland (<r>Ps. 132:6</r>) or mountain top (<r>Judg. 9:32, 36; 2 Sam. 1:21</r>). It denotes sometimes a cultivated region as opposed to the wilderness (<r>Gen. 33:19; 36:35</r>). Unwalled villages or scattered houses are spoken of as 'in the fields' (<r>Deut. 28:3, 16; Lev. 25:31; Mark 6:36, 56</r>). The 'open field' is a place remote from a house (<r>Gen. 4:8; Lev. 14:7, 53; 17:5</r>). Cultivated land of any extent was called a field (<r>Gen. 23:13, 17; 41:8; Lev. 27:16; Ruth 4:5; Neh. 12:29</r>)."},
{i:1152,k:"Fig",t:"First mentioned in Gen. 3:7. The fig-tree is mentioned (<r>Deut. 8:8</r>) as one of the valuable products of Palestine. It was a sign of peace and prosperity (<r>1 Kings 4:25; Micah 4:4; Zech. 3:10</r>). Figs were used medicinally (<r>2 Kings 20:7</r>), and pressed together and formed into 'cakes' as articles of diet (<r>1 Sam. 30:12; Jer. 24:2</r>)."},

{i:1156,k:"Drunk",t:"The first case of intoxication on record is that of Noah (<r>Gen. 9:21</r>). The sin of drunkenness is frequently and strongly condemned (<r>Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 6:9, 10; Eph. 5:18; 1 Thess. 5:7, 8</r>). The sin of drinking to excess seems to have been not uncommon among the Israelites."},
{i:1157,k:"Drusilla",t:"third and youngest daughter of Herod Agrippa I. (<r>Acts 12:1-4, 20-23</r>). Felix, the Roman procurator of Judea, induced her to leave her husband, Azizus, the king of Emesa, and become his wife.

{i:1159,k:"Dulcimer",t:"(Heb. sumphoniah), a musical instrument mentioned in Dan. 3:5, 15, along with other instruments there named, as sounded before the golden image. It was not a Jewish instrument. In the margin of the Revised Version it is styled the 'bag-pipe.' Luther translated it 'lute,' and Grotius the 'crooked trumpet.' It is probable that it was introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by 'organ,' the well-known instrument composed of a series of pipes, others by 'lyre.' The most probable interpretation is that it was a bag-pipe similar to the zampagna of Southern Europe."},
{i:1160,k:"Dumah",t:"silence, (<r>comp. Ps. 94:17</r>), the fourth son of Ishmael; also the tribe descended from him; and hence also the region in Arabia which they inhabited (<r>Gen. 25:14; 1 Chr. 1:30</r>)."},
{i:1161,k:"Dumb",t:"from natural infirmity (<r>Ex. 4:11</r>); not knowing what to say (<r>Prov. 31:8</r>); unwillingness to speak (<r>Ps. 39:9; Lev. 10:3</r>). Christ repeatedly restored the dumb (<r>Matt. 9:32, 33; Luke 11:14; Matt. 12:22</r>) to the use of speech."},

To be 'cast out as dung,' a figurative expression (<r>1 Kings 14:10; 2 Kings 9:37; Jer. 8:2; Ps. 18:42</r>), meaning to be rejected as unprofitable."},
{i:1163,k:"Dung-gate",t:"(<r>Neh. 2:13</r>), a gate of ancient Jerusalem, on the south-west quarter. 'The gate outside of which lay the piles of sweepings and offscourings of the streets,' in the valley of Tophet."},

{i:1165,k:"Dungeon",t:"different from the ordinary prison in being more severe as a place of punishment. Like the Roman inner prison (<r>Acts 16:24</r>), it consisted of a deep cell or cistern (<r>Jer. 38:6</r>). To be shut up in, a punishment common in Egypt (<r>Gen. 39:20; 40:3; 41:10; 42:19</r>). It is not mentioned, however, in the law of Moses as a mode of punishment. Under the later kings imprisonment was frequently used as a punishment (<r>2 Chron. 16:10; Jer. 20:2; 32:2; 33:1; 37:15</r>), and it was customary after the Exile (<r>Matt. 11:2; Luke 3:20; Acts 5:18, 21; Matt. 18:30</r>)."},
{i:1166,k:"Dura",t:"the circle, the plain near Babylon in which Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image, mentioned in Dan. 3:1. The place still retains its ancient name. On one of its many mounds the pedestal of what must have been a colossal statue has been found. It has been supposed to be that of the golden image."},
{i:1167,k:"Dust",t:"Storms of sand and dust sometimes overtake Eastern travellers. They are very dreadful, many perishing under them. Jehovah threatens to bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment for forsaking him, a rain of 'powder and dust' (<r>Deut. 28:24</r>)."},

The exterior was usually whitewashed (<r>Lev. 14:41; Ezek. 13:10; Matt. 23:27</r>). The beams were of sycamore (<r>Isa. 9:10</r>), or olive-wood, or cedar (<r>1 Kings 7:2; Isa. 9:10</r>)."},
{i:1171,k:"Dye",t:"The art of dyeing is one of great antiquity, although no special mention is made of it in the Old Testament. The Hebrews probably learned it from the Egyptians (<r>see Ex. 26:1; 28:5-8</r>), who brought it to great perfection. In New Testament times Thyatira was famed for its dyers (<r>Acts 16:14</r>).

{i:1173,k:"Ear",t:"used frequently in a figurative sense (<r>Ps. 34:15</r>). To 'uncover the ear' is to show respect to a person (<r>1 Sam. 20:2 marg.</r>). To have the 'ear heavy', or to have 'uncircumcised ears' (<r>Isa. 6:10</r>), is to be inattentive and disobedient. To have the ear 'bored' through with an awl was a sign of perpetual servitude (<r>Ex. 21:6</r>)."},
{i:1174,k:"Earing",t:"an Old English word (from the Latin aro, I plough), meaning 'ploughing.' It is used in the Authorized Version in Gen. 45:6; Ex. 34:21; 1 Sam. 8:12; Deut. 21:4; Isa. 30:24; but the Revised Version has rendered the original in these places by the ordinary word to plough or till."},
{i:1175,k:"Earnest",t:"The Spirit is the earnest of the believer's destined inheritance (<r>2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5; Eph. 1:14</r>). The word thus rendered is the same as that rendered 'pledge' in Gen. 38:17-20; 'indeed, the Hebrew word has simply passed into the Greek and Latin languages, probably through commercial dealings with the Phoenicians, the great trading people of ancient days. Originally it meant no more than a pledge; but in common usage it came to denote that particular kind of pledge which is a part of the full price of an article paid in advance; and as it is joined with the figure of a seal when applied to the Spirit, it seems to be used by Paul in this specific sense.' The Spirit's gracious presence and working in believers is a foretaste to them of the blessedness of heaven. God is graciously pleased to give not only pledges but foretastes of future blessedness."},
{i:1176,k:"Earrings",t:"rings properly for the ear (<r>Gen. 35:4; Num. 31:50; Ezek. 16:12</r>). In Gen. 24:47 the word means a nose-jewel, and is so rendered in the Revised Version. In Isa. 3:20 the Authorized Version has 'ear-rings,' and the Revised Version 'amulets,' which more correctly represents the original word (lehashim), which means incantations; charms, thus remedies against enchantment, worn either suspended from the neck or in the ears of females. Ear-rings were ornaments used by both sexes (<r>Ex. 32:2</r>)."},
{i:1177,k:"Earth",t:"(1.) In the sense of soil or ground, the translation of the word _adamah'_. In Gen. 9:20 'husbandman' is literally 'man of the ground or earth.' Altars were to be built of earth (<r>Ex. 20:24</r>). Naaman asked for two mules' burden of earth (<r>2 Kings 5:17</r>), under the superstitious notion that Jehovah, like the gods of the heathen, could be acceptably worshipped only on his own soil."},
{i:1178,k:"Earthquake",t:"mentioned among the extraordinary phenomena of Palestine (<r>Ps. 18:7; comp. Hab. 3:6; Nah. 1:5; Isa. 5:25</r>)."},

{i:1181,k:"East sea",t:"(<r>Joel 2:20; Ezek. 47:18</r>), the Dead Sea, which lay on the east side of the Holy Land. The Mediterranean, which lay on the west, was hence called the 'great sea for the west border' (<r>Num. 34:6</r>)."},
{i:1182,k:"East wind",t:"the wind coming from the east (<r>Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8, etc.</r>). Blight caused by this wind, 'thin ears' (<r>Gen. 41:6</r>); the withered 'gourd' (<r>Jonah 4: 8</r>). It was the cause and also the emblem of evil (<r>Ezek. 17:10; 19:12; Hos. 13:15</r>). In Palestine this wind blows from a burning desert, and hence is destitute of moisture necessary for vegetation."},

{i:1184,k:"Easter",t:"originally a Saxon word (Eostre), denoting a goddess of the Saxons, in honour of whom sacrifices were offered about the time of the Passover. Hence the name came to be given to the festival of the Resurrection of Christ, which occured at the time of the Passover. In the early English versions this word was frequently used as the translation of the Greek pascha (the Passover). When the Authorized Version (1611) was formed, the word 'passover' was used in all passages in which this word pascha occurred, except in Act 12:4. In the Revised Version the proper word, 'passover,' is always used."},
{i:1185,k:"Eating",t:"The ancient Hebrews would not eat with the Egyptians (<r>Gen. 43:32</r>). In the time of our Lord they would not eat with Samaritans (<r>John 4:9</r>), and were astonished that he ate with publicans and sinners (<r>Matt. 9:11</r>). The Hebrews originally sat at table, but afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean practice of reclining (<r>Luke 7:36-50</r>). Their principal meal was at noon (<r>Gen. 43:16; 1 Kings 20:16; Ruth 2:14; Luke 14:12</r>). The word 'eat' is used metaphorically in Jer. 15:16; Ezek. 3:1; Rev. 10:9. In John 6:53-58, 'eating and drinking' means believing in Christ. Women were never present as guests at meals (q.v.)."},

This mountain was also the site of the first great altar erected to Jehovah (<r>Deut. 27:5-8; Josh. 8:30-35</r>). After this the name of Ebal does not again occur in Jewish history.

On this very battle-field, twenty years before, the Philistines routed the Israelites, 'and slew of the army in the field about four thousand men' (4:1,2; here, and at 5:1, called 'Eben-ezer' by anticipation). In this extremity the Israelites fetched the ark out of Shiloh and carried it into their camp. The Philistines a second time immediately attacked them, and smote them with a very great slaughter, 'for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken' (<r>1 Sam. 4:10</r>). And now in the same place the Philistines are vanquished, and the memorial stone is erected by Samuel (q.v.). The spot where the stone was erected was somewhere 'between Mizpeh and Shen.'

This view can be satisfactorily maintained, though others date it from the Captivity. The writer represents himself implicitly as Solomon (1:12). It has been appropriately styled The Confession of King Solomon. 'The writer is a man who has sinned in giving way to selfishness and sensuality, who has paid the penalty of that sin in satiety and weariness of life, but who has through all this been under the discipline of a divine education, and has learned from it the lesson which God meant to teach him.'

The darkness at the crucifixion has been ascribed to an eclipse (<r>Matt. 27:45</r>); but on the other hand it is argued that the great intensity of darkness caused by an eclipse never lasts for more than six minutes, and this darkness lasted for three hours. Moreover, at the time of the Passover the moon was full, and therefore there could not be an eclipse of the sun, which is caused by an interposition of the moon between the sun and the earth."},

The words are literally rendered: 'And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar. It is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.' This great altar stood probably on the east side of the Jordan, in the land of Gilead, 'over against the land of Canaan.' After the division of the Promised Land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, on returning to their own settlements on the east of Jordan (<r>Josh. 22:1-6</r>), erected a great altar, which they affirmed, in answer to the challenge of the other tribes, was not for sacrifice, but only as a witness ('Ed) or testimony to future generations that they still retained the same interest in the nation as the other tribes."},

It has been placed in Armenia, in the region west of the Caspian Sea, in Media, near Damascus, in Palestine, in Southern Arabia, and in Babylonia. The site must undoubtedly be sought for somewhere along the course of the great streams the Tigris and the Euphrates of Western Asia, in 'the land of Shinar' or Babylonia. The region from about lat. 33 degrees 30' to lat. 31 degrees, which is a very rich and fertile tract, has been by the most competent authorities agreed on as the probable site of Eden. 'It is a region where streams abound, where they divide and re-unite, where alone in the Mesopotamian tract can be found the phenomenon of a single river parting into four arms, each of which is or has been a river of consequence.'"},

It subsequently belonged to Manasseh, for a short time apparently, and afterwards became the abode of banditti and outlaws (<r>Josh. 13:31</r>). It has been identified with the modern Edr'a, which stands on a rocky promontory on the south-west edge of the Lejah (the Argob of the Hebrews, and Trachonitis of the Greeks). The ruins of Edr'a are the most extensive in the Hauran. They are 3 miles in circumference. A number of the ancient houses still remain; the walls, roofs, and doors being all of stone. The wild region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in its modern aspect: 'Elevated about 20 feet above the plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress, about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth' (Porter's Syria, etc.). Beneath this wonderful city there is also a subterranean city, hollowed out probably as a refuge for the population of the upper city in times of danger. (See BASHAN"},

In Luke 11:12, an egg is contrasted with a scorpion, which is said to be very like an egg in its appearance, so much so as to be with difficulty at times distinguished from it. In Job 6:6 ('the white of an egg') the word for egg (hallamuth') occurs nowhere else. It has been translated 'purslain' (R.V. marg.), and the whole phrase 'purslain-broth', i.e., broth made of that herb, proverbial for its insipidity; and hence an insipid discourse. Job applies this expression to the speech of Eliphaz as being insipid and dull. But the common rendering, 'the white of an egg', may be satisfactorily maintained."},

This incident was announced to Moses by Joshua, who thought their conduct in this respect irregular.

{i:1218,k:"Elder",t:"a name frequently used in the Old Testament as denoting a person clothed with authority, and entitled to respect and reverence (<r>Gen. 50:7</r>). It also denoted a political office (<r>Num. 22:7</r>). The 'elders of Israel' held a rank among the people indicative of authority. Moses opened his commission to them (<r>Ex. 3:16</r>). They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of the law (<r>Ex. 24:1</r>). Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people (<r>Num. 11:16, 17</r>). The 'elder' is the keystone of the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., 'the old man') is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the 'elders' of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising authority among the people. They appear as governors (<r>Deut. 31:28</r>), as local magistrates (16:18), administering justice (19:12). They were men of extensive influence (<r>1 Sam. 30:26-31</r>).

On Mount Hor he was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from off his brother Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest's office, which he held for more than twenty years (<r>Num. 20:25-29</r>). He took part with Moses in numbering the people (26:3, 4), and assisted at the inauguration of Joshua. He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest (<r>Josh. 14:1</r>). The high-priesthood remained in his family till the time of Eli, into whose family it passed, till it was restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok (<r>1 Sam. 2:35; comp. 1 Kings 2:27</r>). 'And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son' (<r>Josh. 24:33</r>). The word here rendered 'hill' is Gibeah, the name of several towns in Palestine which were generally on or near a hill. The words may be more suitably rendered, 'They buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas', i.e., in the city of Phinehas, which has been identified, in accordance with Jewish and Samaritan traditions, with Kefr Ghuweirah='Awertah, about 7 miles north of Shiloh, and a few miles south-east of Nablus.

They are 'of the world,' because they are made up of types which appeal to the senses.

On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (<r>comp. Luke 9:61, 62</r>). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah's life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, 'a double portion' of Elijah's spirit (<r>2 Kings 2:9</r>); and for the long period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office of 'prophet in Israel' (<r>2 Kings 5:8</r>)."},

It was made of fine linen, and consisted of two pieces, which hung from the neck, and covered both the back and front, above the tunic and outer garment (<r>Ex. 28:31</r>). That of the high priest was embroidered with divers colours.

The first incident recorded regarding him is his being placed, along with his brother Manasseh, before their grandfather, Jacob, that he might bless them (48:10; comp. 27:1). The intention of Joseph was that the right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the head of the elder of the two; but Jacob set Ephraim the younger before his brother, 'guiding his hands wittingly.'

It lay on the left bank of the Euphrates, about 120 miles south-east of Babylon, and is now represented by the mounds and ruins of Warka. It appears to have been the necropolis of the Assyrian kings, as the whole region is strewed with bricks and the remains of coffins. 'Standing on the summit of the principal edifice, called the Buwarizza, a tower 200 feet square in the centre of the ruins, the beholder is struck with astonishment at the enormous accumulation of mounds and ancient relics at his feet.

The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a 'son of the desert,' devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing (<r>Gen. 27:28, 29, 36; Heb. 12:16, 17</r>).

It is drained by 'that ancient river' the Kishon, which flows westward to the Mediterranean. From the foot of Mount Tabor it branches out into three valleys, that on the north passing between Tabor and Little Hermon (<r>Judg. 4:14</r>); that on the south between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim (<r>2 Kings 9:27</r>); while the central portion, the 'valley of Jezreel' proper, runs into the Jordan valley (which is about 1,000 feet lower than Esdraelon) by Bethshean. Here Gideon gained his great victory over the Midianites (<r>Judg. 7:1-25</r>). Here also Barak defeated Sisera, and Saul's army was defeated by the Philistines, and king Josiah, while fighting in disguise against Necho, king of Egypt, was slain (<r>2 Chr. 35:20-27; 2 Kings 23-29</r>). This plain has been well called the 'battle-field of Palestine.' 'It has been a chosen place for encampment in every contest carried on in this country, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, in the history of whose wars with Arphaxad it is mentioned as the Great Plain of Esdraelon, until the disastrous march of Napoleon Bonaparte from Egypt into Syria. Jews, Gentiles, Saracens, Crusaders, Frenchmen, Egyptians, Persians, Druses, Turks, and Arabs, warriors out of every nation which is under heaven, have pitched their tents in the plain, and have beheld the various banners of their nations wet with the dews of Tabor and Hermon' (Dr. Clark)."},

It is a Syro-Arabian modification of the Persian word satarah, which means a star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her family did not avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to the exiles to return to Jerusalem; and she resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king at 'Shushan in the palace.' Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose Esther to be his wife. Soon after this he gave Haman the Agagite, his prime minister, power and authority to kill and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian empire. By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe was averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had intended for Mordecai (Esther 7); and the Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of their wonderful deliverance.

Ishmael, however, at the head of a party of the royal family, 'Jewish irreconcilables', rose against him, and slew him and 'all the Jews that were with him' (<r>Jer. 41:2, 3</r>) at Mizpah about three months after the destruction of Jerusalem. He and his band also plundered the town of Mizpah, and carried off many captives. He was, however, overtaken by Johanan and routed. He fled with such of his followers as escaped to the Ammonites (41:15). The little remnant of the Jews now fled to Egypt."},

It is the feminine form of Geder (12:13); the plural form is Gederoth (15:41).

The expressions 'fire from heaven' and 'fire of the Lord' generally denote lightning, but sometimes also the fire of the altar was so called (<r>Ex. 29:18; Lev. 1:9; 2:3; 3:5, 9</r>)."},
{i:1387,k:"Firebrand",t:"Isa. 7:4, Amos 4:11, Zech. 3:2, denotes the burnt end of a stick (Heb. 'ud); in Judg. 15:4, a lamp or torch, a flambeau (Heb. lappid); in Prov. 26:18 (<r>comp. Eph. 6:16</r>), burning darts or arrows (Heb. zikkim)."},

{i:1390,k:"Firmament",t:"from the Vulgate firmamentum, which is used as the translation of the Hebrew _raki'a_. This word means simply 'expansion.' It denotes the space or expanse like an arch appearing immediately above us. They who rendered _raki'a_ by firmamentum regarded it as a solid body. The language of Scripture is not scientific but popular, and hence we read of the sun rising and setting, and also here the use of this particular word. It is plain that it was used to denote solidity as well as expansion. It formed a division between the waters above and the waters below (<r>Gen. 1:7</r>). The _raki'a_ supported the upper reservoir (<r>Ps. 148:4</r>). It was the support also of the heavenly bodies (<r>Gen. 1:14</r>), and is spoken of as having 'windows' and 'doors' (<r>Gen. 7:11; Isa. 24:18; Mal. 3:10</r>) through which the rain and snow might descend."},

But when the extensive plan of sacrificial worship was introduced, requiring a company of men to be exclusively devoted to this ministry, the primitive office of the first-born was superseded by that of the Levites (<r>Num. 3:11-13</r>), and it was ordained that the first-born of man and of unclean animals should henceforth be redeemed (18:15)."},

{i:1395,k:"Fish",t:"called _dag_ by the Hebrews, a word denoting great fecundity (<r>Gen. 9:2; Num. 11:22; Jonah 2:1, 10</r>). No fish is mentioned by name either in the Old or in the New Testament. Fish abounded in the Mediterranean and in the lakes of the Jordan, so that the Hebrews were no doubt acquainted with many species. Two of the villages on the shores of the Sea of Galilee derived their names from their fisheries, Bethsaida (the 'house of fish') on the east and on the west. There is probably no other sheet of water in the world of equal dimensions that contains such a variety and profusion of fish. About thirty-seven different kinds have been found. Some of the fishes are of a European type, such as the roach, the barbel, and the blenny; others are markedly African and tropical, such as the eel-like silurus. There was a regular fish-market apparently in Jerusalem (<r>2 Chr. 33:14; Neh. 3:3; 12:39; Zeph. 1:10</r>), as there was a fish-gate which was probably contiguous to it."},

He twice miraculously fed multitudes with fish and bread (<r>Matt. 14:19; 15:36</r>). It was in the mouth of a fish that the tribute-money was found (<r>Matt. 17:27</r>). And he 'ate a piece of broiled fish' with his disciples after his resurrection (<r>Luke 24:42, 43; comp. Acts 1:3</r>). At the Sea of Tiberias (<r>John 21:1-14</r>), in obedience to his direction, the disciples cast their net 'on the right side of the ship,' and enclosed so many that 'they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.'"},

'Flagons of wine' of the Authorized Version should be, as in the Revised Version, 'cakes of raisins' in all these passages. In Isa. 22:24 it is the rendering of the Hebrew _nebel_, which properly means a bottle or vessel of skin. (Comp. 1 Sam. 1:24; 10:3; 25:18; 2 Sam. 16:1, where the same Hebrew word is used.)"},

{i:1404,k:"Flax",t:"(Heb. pishtah, i.e., 'peeled', in allusion to the fact that the stalks of flax when dried were first split or peeled before being steeped in water for the purpose of destroying the pulp). This plant was cultivated from earliest times. The flax of Egypt was destroyed by the plague of hail when it 'was bolled', i.e., was forming pods for seed (<r>Ex. 9:31</r>). It was extensively cultivated both in Egypt and Palestine. Reference is made in Josh. 2:6 to the custom of drying flax-stalks by exposing them to the sun on the flat roofs of houses. It was much used in forming articles of clothing such as girdles, also cords and bands (<r>Lev. 13:48, 52, 59; Deut. 22:11</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See LINEN.</see>)"},

He thus speaks of himself as the poor, contemptible object of the monarch's pursuit, a 'worthy object truly for an expedition of the king of Israel with his picked troops!' This insect is in Eastern language the popular emblem of insignificance. In 1 Sam. 26:20 the LXX. read 'come out to seek my life' instead of 'to seek a flea.'"},

Isa. 31:3; Ps. 78:39</r>). As suggesting the idea of softness it is used in the expression 'heart of flesh' (<r>Ezek. 11:19</r>). The expression 'my flesh and bone' (<r>Judg. 9:2; Isa. 58:7</r>) denotes relationship."},
{i:1408,k:"Flesh-hook",t:"a many-pronged fork used in the sacrificial services (<r>1 Sam. 2:13, 14; Ex. 27:3; 38:3</r>) by the priest in drawing away the flesh. The fat of the sacrifice, together with the breast and shoulder (<r>Lev. 7:29-34</r>), were presented by the worshipper to the priest. The fat was burned on the alter (3:3-5), and the breast and shoulder became the portion of the priests. But Hophni and Phinehas, not content with this, sent a servant to seize with a flesh-hook a further portion."},

The flour mingled with water was kneaded in kneading-troughs, and sometimes leaven (<r>Ex. 12:34</r>) was added and sometimes omitted (<r>Gen. 19:3</r>). The dough was then formed into thin cakes nine or ten inches in diameter and baked in the oven."},

It has been calculated that in Western Syria and Palestine from two thousand to two thousand five hundred plants are found, of which about five hundred probably are British wild-flowers.

They are referred to as affording an emblem of the transitory nature of human life (<r>Job 14:2; Ps. 103:15; Isa. 28:1; 40:6; James 1:10</r>).

Poisonous flies exist in many parts of Africa, for instance, the different kinds of tsetse."},

'Among the pots,' of the Authorized Version (<r>Ps. 68:13</r>), is rightly in the Revised Version, 'among the sheepfolds.'"},
{i:1418,k:"Food",t:"Originally the Creator granted the use of the vegetable world for food to man (<r>Gen. 1:29</r>), with the exception mentioned (2:17). The use of animal food was probably not unknown to the antediluvians. There is, however, a distinct law on the subject given to Noah after the Deluge (<r>Gen. 9:2-5</r>). Various articles of food used in the patriarchal age are mentioned in Gen. 18:6-8; 25:34; 27:3, 4; 43:11. Regarding the food of the Israelites in Egypt, see Ex. 16:3; Num. 11:5.

It was in this forest that Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to the forest of Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the fury of Saul (<r>1 Sam. 22:5</r>).

{i:1438,k:"Frontlets",t:"occurs only in Ex. 13:16; Deut. 6:8, and 11:18. The meaning of the injunction to the Israelites, with regard to the statues and precepts given them, that they should 'bind them for a sign upon their hand, and have them as frontlets between their eyes,' was that they should keep them distinctly in view and carefully attend to them. But soon after their return from Babylon they began to interpret this injunction literally, and had accordingly portions of the law written out and worn about their person. These they called tephillin, i.e., 'prayers.' The passages so written out on strips of parchment were these, Ex. 12:2-10; 13:11-21; Deut. 6:4-9; 11:18-21. They were then 'rolled up in a case of black calfskin, which was attached to a stiffer piece of leather, having a thong one finger broad and one cubit and a half long. Those worn on the forehead were written on four strips of parchment, and put into four little cells within a square case, which had on it the Hebrew letter called shin, the three points of which were regarded as an emblem of God.' This case tied around the forehead in a particular way was called 'the tephillah on the head.' (<see target='x-self'>See PHYLACTERY.</see>)"},

Mention is made of 'fuller's soap' (<r>Mal. 3:2</r>), and of 'the fuller's field' (<r>2 Kings 18:17</r>). At his transfiguration our Lord's rainment is said to have been white 'so as no fuller on earth could white them' (<r>Mark 9:3</r>). En-rogel (q.v.), meaning literally 'foot-fountain,' has been interpreted as the 'fuller's fountain,' because there the fullers trod the cloth with their feet."},

The plural form is more commonly used in all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.), the only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme Being, is uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by 'LORD,' printed in small capitals. The existence of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There is nowhere any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is spoken of as one devoid of understanding (<r>Ps. 14:1</r>)."},

This name represents in Greek letters the Aramaic word Gulgaltha, which is the Hebrew Gulgoleth (<r>Num. 1:2; 1 Chr. 23:3, 24; 2 Kings 9:35</r>), meaning 'a skull.' It is identical with the word Calvary (q.v.). It was a little knoll rounded like a bare skull. It is obvious from the evangelists that it was some well-known spot outside the gate (<r>comp. Heb. 13:12</r>), and near the city (<r>Luke 23:26</r>), containing a 'garden' (<r>John 19:41</r>), and on a thoroughfare leading into the country. Hence it is an untenable idea that it is embraced within the present 'Church of the Holy Sepulchre.' The hillock above Jeremiah's Grotto, to the north of the city, is in all probability the true site of Calvary. The skull-like appearance of the rock in the southern precipice of the hillock is very remarkable."},

He was probably descended from the Rephaim who found refuge among the Philistines after they were dispersed by the Ammonites (<r>Deut. 2:20, 21</r>). His height was 'six cubits and a span,' which, taking the cubit at 21 inches, is equal to 10 1/2 feet. David cut off his head (<r>1 Sam. 17:51</r>) and brought it to Jerusalem, while he hung the armour which he took from him in his tent. His sword was preserved at Nob as a religious trophy (21:9). David's victory over Goliath was the turning point in his life.

These cities probably stood close together, and were near the northern extremity of what is now the Dead Sea. This city is always mentioned next after Sodom, both of which were types of impiety and wickedness (<r>Gen. 18:20; Rom. 9:29</r>). Their destruction is mentioned as an 'ensample unto those that after should live ungodly' (<r>2 Pet. 2:6; Jude 1:4-7</r>). Their wickedness became proverbial (<r>Deut. 32:32; Isa. 1:9, 10; Jer. 23:14</r>). But that wickedness may be exceeded (<r>Matt. 10:15; Mark 6:11</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See DEAD SEA</see>)."},

Viewed generally, it is benevolence; as exercised with respect to the miseries of his creatures it is mercy, pity, compassion, and in the case of impenitent sinners, long-suffering patience; as exercised in communicating favour on the unworthy it is grace. 'Goodness and justice are the several aspects of one unchangeable, infinitely wise, and sovereign moral perfection. God is not sometimes merciful and sometimes just, but he is eternally infinitely just and merciful.' God is infinitely and unchangeably good (<r>Zeph. 3:17</r>), and his goodness is incomprehensible by the finite mind (<r>Rom. 11: 35, 36</r>). 'God's goodness appears in two things, giving and forgiving.'"},

It is called 'the land of Goshen' (47:27), and also simply 'Goshen' (46:28), and 'the land of Rameses' (47:11; Ex. 12:37), for the towns Pithom and Rameses lay within its borders; also Zoan or Tanis (<r>Ps. 78:12</r>). It lay on the east of the Nile, and apparently not far from the royal residence. It was 'the best of the land' (<r>Gen. 47:6, 11</r>), but is now a desert. It is first mentioned in Joseph's message to his father. It has been identified with the modern Wady Tumilat, lying between the eastern part of the Delta and the west border of Palestine. It was a pastoral district, where some of the king's cattle were kept (<r>Gen. 47:6</r>). The inhabitants were not exclusively Israelites (<r>Ex. 3:22; 11:2; 12:35, 36</r>)."},

It was afterwards transitively applied to each of the four histories of our Lord's life, published by those who are therefore called 'Evangelists', writers of the history of the gospel (the evangelion). (3.) The term is often used to express collectively the gospel doctrines; and 'preaching the gospel' is often used to include not only the proclaiming of the good tidings, but the teaching men how to avail themselves of the offer of salvation, the declaring of all the truths, precepts, promises, and threatenings of Christianity.' It is termed 'the gospel of the grace of God' (<r>Acts 20:24</r>), 'the gospel of the kingdom' (<r>Matt. 4:23</r>), 'the gospel of Christ' (<r>Rom. 1:16</r>), 'the gospel of peace (<r>Eph. 6:15</r>), 'the glorious gospel,' 'the everlasting gospel,' 'the gospel of salvation' (<r>Eph. 1:13</r>)."},

{i:1473,k:"Gourd",t:"(1.) Jonah's gourd (<r>Jonah 4:6-10</r>), bearing the Hebrew name _kikayon_ (found only here), was probably the kiki of the Egyptians, the croton. This is the castor-oil plant, a species of ricinus, the palma Christi, so called from the palmate division of its leaves. Others with more probability regard it as the cucurbita the el-keroa of the Arabs, a kind of pumpkin peculiar to the East. 'It is grown in great abundance on the alluvial banks of the Tigris and on the plain between the river and the ruins of Nineveh.' At the present day it is trained to run over structures of mud and brush to form boots to protect the gardeners from the heat of the noon-day sun.

{i:1500,k:"Gehenna",t:"(originally Ge bene Hinnom; i.e., 'the valley of the sons of Hinnom'), a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem, where the idolatrous Jews offered their children in sacrifice to Molech (<r>2 Chr. 28:3; 33:6; Jer. 7:31; 19:2-6</r>). This valley afterwards became the common receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning. It thus in process of time became the image of the place of everlasting destruction. In this sense it is used by our Lord in Matt. 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5.

Both of these patriarchs were guilty of the sin of here denying their wives, and both of them entered into a treaty with the king before they departed to Beersheba (21:23-34; 26). It seems to have been a rich pastoral country (<r>2 Chr. 14:12-18</r>). Isaac here reaped an hundred-fold, and was blessed of God (<r>Gen. 26:12</r>).

On the slopes of this mountain the tribes descended from the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe of Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to the blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when Joshua in the valley below read the whole law in the hearing of all the people; as those gathered on Ebal responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of the curses pronounced on the disobedient.

The Geshurites probably inhabited the rocky fastness of Argob, the modern Lejah, in the north-east corner of Bashan.

The plot of ground pointed out as Gethsemane is now surrounded by a wall, and is laid out as a modern European flower-garden. It contains eight venerable olive-trees, the age of which cannot, however, be determined. The exact site of Gethsemane is still in question. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book) says: 'When I first came to Jerusalem, and for many years afterward, this plot of ground was open to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath its very old olivetrees. The Latins, however, have within the last few years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and have built a high wall around it...The Greeks have invented another site a little to the north of it...My own impression is that both are wrong. The position is too near the city, and so close to what must have always been the great thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely have selected it for retirement on that dangerous and dismal night...I am inclined to place the garden in the secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east of the present Gethsemane.'"},

It stood between the lower Beth-horon and the sea (<r>Josh. 16:3; 1 Kings 9:17</r>). It was the last point to which David pursued the Philistines (<r>2 Sam. 5:25; 1 Chr. 14:16</r>) after the battle of Baal-perazim. The Canaanites retained possession of it till the time of Solomon, when the king of Egypt took it and gave it to Solomon as a part of the dowry of the Egyptian princess whom he married (<r>1 Kings 9:15-17</r>).

The word may also be derived from a root signifying 'wonder,' and hence 'monsters' or 'prodigies.' In Num. 13:33 this name is given to a Canaanitish tribe, a race of large stature, 'the sons of Anak.' The Revised Version, in these passages, simply transliterates the original, and reads 'Nephilim.'"},

It was here that the terrible outrage was committed on the Levite's concubine which led to the almost utter extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin (Judg. 19; 20), only six hundred men surviving after a succession of disastrous battles. This was the birthplace of Saul, and continued to be his residence after he became king (<r>1 Sam. 10:26; 11:4; 15:34</r>). It was reckoned among the ancient sanctuaries of Palestine (10:26; 15:34; 23:19; 26:1; 2 Sam. 21:6-10), and hence it is called 'Gibeah of God' (<r>1 Sam. 10:5, R.V. marg.</r>).

It lay within the territory of Benjamin, and became a priest-city (18:25; 21:17). Here the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was built by Solomon.

{i:1528,k:"Gideon",t:"called also Jerubbaal (<r>Judg. 6:29, 32</r>), was the first of the judges whose history is circumstantially narrated (Judg. 6-8). His calling is the commencement of the second period in the history of the judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the Midianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other 'children of the east,' crossed the Jordan each year for seven successive years for the purpose of plundering and desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from God to undertake the task of delivering the land from these warlike invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer (<r>Josh. 17:2; 1 Chr. 7:18</r>), and of the little township of Ophrah (<r>Judg. 6:11</r>). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, 'For the Lord and for Gideon' (<r>Judg. 7:18, R.V.</r>). Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation (<r>1 Sam. 12:11; Ps. 83:11; Isa. 9:4; 10:26; Heb. 11:32</r>). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, 'neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal' (<r>Judg. 8:35</r>). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who slaughtered all Gideon's sons, except Jotham, upon one stone. (<see target='x-self'>See OPHRAH.</see>)"},
{i:1529,k:"Gier eagle",t:"Heb. raham = 'parental affection,' Lev. 11:18; Deut. 14:17; R.V., 'vulture'), a species of vulture living entirely on carrion. 'It is about the size of a raven; has an almost triangular, bald, and wrinkled head, a strong pointed beak, black at the tip, large eyes and ears, the latter entirely on the outside, and long feet.' It is common in Egypt, where it is popularly called 'Pharaoh's chicken' (the Neophron percnopterus), and is found in Palestine only during summer. Tristram thinks that the Hebrew name, which is derived from a root meaning 'to love,' is given to it from the fact that the male and female bird never part company."},

These charismata were enjoyed only for a time. They could not continue always in the Church. They were suited to its infancy and to the necessities of those times."},
{i:1532,k:"Gihon",t:"a stream. (1.) One of the four rivers of Eden (<r>Gen. 2:13</r>). It has been identified with the Nile. Others regard it as the Oxus, or the Araxes, or the Ganges. But as, according to the sacred narrative, all these rivers of Eden took their origin from the head-waters of the Euphrates and the Trigris, it is probable that the Gihon is the ancient Araxes, which, under the modern name of the Arras, discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. It was the Asiatic and not the African 'Cush' which the Gihon compassed (<r>Gen. 10:7-10</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See EDEN.</see>)"},

It was a low barren range of mountains bounding the valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel) on the east, between it and the Jordan valley. When the tidings of this defeat were conveyed to David, he gave utterance to those pathetic words in the 'Song of the Bow' (<r>2 Sam. 1:19-27</r>)."},
{i:1534,k:"Gilead",t:"hill of testimony, (<r>Gen. 31:21</r>), a mountainous region east of Jordan. From its mountainous character it is called 'the mount of Gilead' (<r>Gen. 31:25</r>). It is called also 'the land of Gilead' (<r>Num. 32:1</r>), and sometimes simply 'Gilead' (<r>Ps. 60:7; Gen. 37:25</r>). It comprised the possessions of the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the south part of Manasseh (<r>Deut. 3:13; Num. 32:40</r>). It was bounded on the north by Bashan, and on the south by Moab and Ammon (<r>Gen. 31:21; Deut. 3:12-17</r>). 'Half Gilead' was possessed by Sihon, and the other half, separated from it by the river Jabbok, by Og, king of Bashan. The deep ravine of the river Hieromax (the modern Sheriat el-Mandhur) separated Bashan from Gilead, which was about 60 miles in length and 20 in breadth, extending from near the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret to the north end of the Dead Sea.

It was 'beside the oaks of Moreh,' near which Abraham erected his first altar (<r>Gen. 12:6, 7</r>). This was one of the three towns to which Samuel resorted for the administration of justice (<r>1 Sam. 7:16</r>), and here also he offered sacrifices when the ark was no longer in the tabernacle at Shiloh (<r>1 Sam. 10:8; 13:7-9</r>). To this place, as to a central sanctuary, all Israel gathered to renew their allegiance to Saul (11:14). At a later period it became the scene of idolatrous worship (<r>Hos. 4:15; 9:15</r>).

And on this occasion the future punishment of the Chaldeans was revealed to him (2). In the third chapter a presentiment of the destruction of his country, in the inspired heart of the prophet, contends with his hope that the enemy would be chastised.'

After his reconciliation with Saul at Engedi (24:1-8), David returned to Hachilah, where he had fixed his quarters. The Ziphites treacherously informed Saul of this, and he immediately (26:1-4) renewed his pursuit of David, and 'pitched in the hill of Hachilah.' David and his nephew Abishai stole at night into the midst of Saul's camp, when they were all asleep, and noiselessly removed the royal spear and the cruse from the side of the king, and then, crossing the intervening valley to the height on the other side, David cried to the people, and thus awoke the sleepers. He then addressed Saul, who recognized his voice, and expostulated with him. Saul professed to be penitent; but David could not put confidence in him, and he now sought refuge at Ziklag.

In the battle which was fought the Syrians were scattered, and the Ammonites in alarm fled into their capital. After this Hadadezer went north 'to recover his border' (<r>2 Sam. 8:3, A.V.</r>); but rather, as the Revised Version renders, 'to recover his dominion', i.e., to recruit his forces. Then followed another battle with the Syrian army thus recruited, which resulted in its being totally routed at Helam (<r>2 Sam. 10:17</r>). Shobach, the leader of the Syrian army, died on the field of battle. The Syrians of Damascus, who had come to help Hadadezer, were also routed, and Damascus was made tributary to David. All the spoils taken in this war, 'shields of gold' and 'very much brass,' from which afterwards the 'brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass' for the temple were made (<r>1 Chr. 18:8</r>), were brought to Jerusalem and dedicated to Jehovah.

In obedience to the heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of Abraham, where her son Ishmael was born, and where she remained (16) till after the birth of Isaac, the space of fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent her dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael's conduct was insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he and his mother should be dismissed. This was accordingly done, although with reluctance on the part of Abraham (<r>Gen. 21:14</r>). They wandered out into the wilderness, where Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint from thirst, seemed about to die.

Joseph shaved himself before going in to Pharoah (<r>Gen. 41:14</r>). The women of Egypt wore their hair long and plaited.

The Levites, standing before the altar, chanted it verse by verse, the people responding by repeating the verses or by intoned hallelujahs. It was also chanted in private families at the feast of Passover.

Ex. 13:10</r>). On occasion of one of these 'yearly' visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah's conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct (<r>1 Sam. 1:14-16</r>). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, 'Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition.' Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord's goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., 'heard of God.' After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, 'Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord' (<r>1 Sam. 1:27, 28, R.V.</r>).

Luke 1:46-55) which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name (<r>1 Sam. 2:10, 'Annointed' = 'Messiah'</r>). And so Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister 'before the Lord.' And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to her absent child 'a little coat' (Heb. meil, a term used to denote the 'robe' of the ephod worn by the high priest, Ex. 28:31), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic (<r>1 Chr. 15:27</r>), in which to minister in the tabernacle (<r>1 Sam. 2:19; 15:27; Job 2:12</r>).

Among the fugitives from Gilboa was Ish-bosheth, the only surviving son of Saul, whom Abner, Saul's uncle, took across the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there had him proclaimed king. Abner gathered all the forces at his command and marched to Gibeon, with the object of wresting Judah from David. Joab had the command of David's army of trained men, who encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of the hill on which the town of Gibeon was built, while Abner's army lay on the north of the pool. Abner proposed that the conflict should be decided by twelve young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So fiercely did they encounter each other that 'they caught every man his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim.' The combat of the champions was thus indecisive, and there followed a severe general engagement between the two armies, ending in the total rout of the Israelites under Abner.

Paul ranks 'heresies' with crimes and seditions (<r>Gal. 5:20</r>). This word also denotes divisions or schisms in the church (<r>1 Cor. 11:19</r>). In Titus 3:10 a 'heretical person' is one who follows his own self-willed 'questions,' and who is to be avoided.

The testimony of the sacred writers themselves abundantly demonstrates this truth; and if they are infallible as teachers of doctrine, then the doctrine of plenary inspiration must be accepted. There are no errors in the Bible as it came from God, none have been proved to exist. Difficulties and phenomena we cannot explain are not errors. All these books of the Old and New Testaments are inspired. We do not say that they contain, but that they are, the Word of God.

It is first mentioned in Josh. 15:8. It had been the place where the idolatrous Jews burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A particular part of the valley was called Tophet, or the 'fire-stove,' where the children were burned. After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the offal of the city, for the destruction of which a fire was, as is supposed, kept constantly burning there."},

They were nomadic and pastoral tribes. (2.) The Phoenicians, who were merchants and traders; and (3.) the Hittites, who were the warlike element of this confederation of tribes. They inhabited the whole region between the Euphrates and Damascus, their chief cities being Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Kadesh, now Tell Neby Mendeh, in the Orontes valley, about six miles south of the Lake of Homs. These Hittites seem to have risen to great power as a nation, as for a long time they were formidable rivals of the Egyptian and Assyrian empires. In the book of Joshua they always appear as the dominant race to the north of Galilee."},

The name is interpreted as 'midlanders' or 'villagers' (<r>Gen. 10:17; 1 Chr. 1:15</r>). They were probably a branch of the Hittites.

'Hope is an essential and fundamental element of Christian life, so essential indeed, that, like faith and love, it can itself designate the essence of Christianity (<r>1 Pet. 3:15; Heb. 10:23</r>). In it the whole glory of the Christian vocation is centred (<r>Eph. 1:18; 4:4</r>).' Unbelievers are without this hope (<r>Eph. 2:12; 1 Thess. 4:13</r>). Christ is the actual object of the believer's hope, because it is in his second coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled (<r>1 Tim. 1:1; Col. 1:27; Titus 2:13</r>). It is spoken of as 'lively', i.e., a living, hope, a hope not frail and perishable, but having a perennial life (<r>1 Pet. 1:3</r>). In Rom. 5:2 the 'hope' spoken of is probably objective, i.e., 'the hope set before us,' namely, eternal life (<r>comp. 12:12</r>).

By their scandalous conduct they brought down a curse on their father's house (2:22, 12-27, 27-36; 3:11-14). For their wickedness they were called 'sons of Belial,' i.e., worthless men (2:12).

It was one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness (33:37), which they reached in the circuitous route they were obliged to take because the Edomites refused them a passage through their territory. It was during the encampment here that Aaron died (<r>Num. 33:37-41</r>). (<see target='x-self'>See AARON.</see>) The Israelites passed this mountain several times in their wanderings.

The modern name of the whole range is Jebel Musa.

After the manifestation of God's anger against the Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the land, they quickly repented of their conduct, and presumed to go up 'to the head of the mountain,' seeking to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence of the Lord, without the ark of the convenant, and without Moses. The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and 'smote and discomfited them even unto Hormah' (<r>Num. 14:45</r>). This place, or perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was originally called Zephath (<r>Judg. 1:17</r>), the modern Sebaiteh. Afterwards (<r>Num. 21:1-3</r>) Arad, the king of the Canaanites, at the close of the wanderings, when the Israelites were a second time encamped at Kadesh, 'fought against them, and took some of them prisoners.' But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord utterly to destroy the cities of the Canaanites; they 'banned' them, and hence the place was now called Hormah. But this 'ban' was not fully executed till the time of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of this district, so that the ancient name Zephath became 'Hormah' (<r>Josh. 12:14; Judg. 1:17</r>)."},

The word is used in these passages as referring to some means by which the Canaanites were to be driven out from before the Israelites. Some have supposed that the word is used in a metaphorical sense as the symbol of some panic which would seize the people as a 'terror of God' (<r>Gen. 35:5</r>), the consternation with which God would inspire the Canaanites. In Palestine there are four species of hornets, differing from our hornets, being larger in size, and they are very abundant. They 'attack human beings in a very furious manner.' 'The furious attack of a swarm of hornets drives cattle and horses to madness, and has even caused the death of the animals.'"},

But Solomon, from his connection with Egypt, greatly multiplied their number (<r>1 Kings 4:26; 10:26, 29</r>). After this, horses were freely used in Israel (<r>1 Kings 22:4; 2 Kings 3:7; 9:21, 33; 11:16</r>). The furniture of the horse consisted simply of a bridle (<r>Isa. 30:28</r>) and a curb (<r>Ps. 32:9</r>)."},

That here referred to, the Hoemopis, is remarkable for the coarseness of its bite, and is therefore not used for medical purposes. They are spoken of in the East with feelings of aversion and horror, because of their propensity to fasten on the tongue and nostrils of horses when they come to drink out of the pools.

This was the longest of the prophetic books written before the Captivity. Hosea prophesied in a dark and melancholy period of Israel's history, the period of Israel's decline and fall. Their sins had brought upon them great national disasters. 'Their homicides and fornication, their perjury and theft, their idolatry and impiety, are censured and satirized with a faithful severity.' He was a contemporary of Isaiah. The book may be divided into two parts, the first containing chapters 1-3, and symbolically representing the idolatry of Israel under imagery borrowed from the matrimonial relation. The figures of marriage and adultery are common in the Old Testament writings to represent the spiritual relations between Jehovah and the people of Israel.

When David fled from Jerusalem, on account of the rebellion of Absalom, and had reached the summit of Olivet, he there met Hushai, whom he sent back to Jerusalem for the purpose of counteracting the influence of Ahithophel, who had joined the ranks of Absalom (<r>2 Sam. 15:32, 37; 16:16-18</r>). It was by his advice that Absalom refrained from immediately pursuing after David. By this delay the cause of Absalom was ruined, for it gave David time to muster his forces."},
{i:1894,k:"Husk",t:"In Num. 6:4 (Heb. zag) it means the 'skin' of a grape. In 2 Kings 4:42 (Heb. tsiqlon) it means a 'sack' for grain, as rendered in the Revised Version. In Luke 15:16, in the parable of the Prodigal Son, it designates the beans of the carob tree, or Ceratonia siliqua. From the supposition, mistaken, however, that it was on the husks of this tree that John the Baptist fed, it is called 'St. John's bread' and 'locust tree.' This tree is in 'February covered with innumerable purple-red pendent blossoms, which ripen in April and May into large crops of pods from 6 to 10 inches long, flat, brown, narrow, and bent like a horn (whence the Greek name keratia, meaning 'little horns'), with a sweetish taste when still unripe. Enormous quantities of these are gathered for sale in various towns and for exportation.' 'They were eaten as food, though only by the poorest of the poor, in the time of our Lord.' The bean is called a 'gerah,' which is used as the name of the smallest Hebrew weight, twenty of these making a shekel."},
{i:1895,k:"Hymn",t:"occurs only Eph. 5:19 and Col. 3:16. The verb to 'sing an hymn' occurs Matt. 26:30 and Mark 14:26. The same Greek word is rendered to 'sing praises' Acts 16:25 (R.V., 'sing hymns') and Heb. 2:12. The 'hymn' which our Lord sang with his disciples at the last Supper is generally supposed to have been the latter part of the Hallel, comprehending Ps. 113-118. It was thus a name given to a number of psalms taken together and forming a devotional exercise."},
{i:1896,k:"Hypocrite",t:"one who puts on a mask and feigns himself to be what he is not; a dissembler in religion. Our Lord severely rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy (<r>Matt. 6:2, 5, 16</r>). 'The hypocrite's hope shall perish' (<r>Job 8:13</r>). The Hebrew word here rendered 'hypocrite' rather means the 'godless' or 'profane,' as it is rendered in Jer. 23:11, i.e., polluted with crimes."},
{i:1897,k:"Hyssop",t:"(Heb. 'ezob; LXX. hyssopos), first mentioned in Ex. 12:22 in connection with the institution of the Passover. We find it afterwards mentioned in Lev. 14:4, 6, 52; Num. 19:6, 18; Heb. 9:19. It is spoken of as a plant 'springing out of the wall' (<r>1 Kings 4:33</r>). Many conjectures have been formed as to what this plant really was. Some contend that it was a species of marjoram (origanum), six species of which are found in Palestine. Others with more probability think that it was the caper plant, the Capparis spinosa of Linnaeus. This plant grew in Egypt, in the desert of Sinai, and in Palestine. It was capable of producing a stem three or four feet in length (<r>Matt. 27:48; Mark 15:36. Comp. John 19:29</r>)."},

Here they were persecuted by the Jews, and being driven from the city, they fled to Lystra. They afterwards returned to Iconium, and encouraged the church which had been founded there (14:21,22).

It was traversed by Paul in his third missionary journey (<r>Rom. 15:19</r>). It was the farthest district he had reached in preaching the gospel of Christ.

It still exists, but although after copious rains it contains a little water, it is now usually quite dry. It is at the entrance to the valley between Ebal and Gerizim, about 2 miles south-east of Shechem. It is about 9 feet in diameter and about 75 feet in depth, though in ancient times it was no doubt much deeper, probably twice as deep.

As he drew near, Jael invited him to enter her tent. He did so, and as he lay wearied on the floor he fell into a deep sleep. She then took in her left hand one of the great wooden pins ('nail') which fastened down the cords of the tent, and in her right hand the mallet, or 'hammer,' used for driving it into the ground, and stealthily approaching her sleeping guest, with one well-directed blow drove the nail through his temples into the earth (<r>Judg. 5:27</r>).

Whenever this name occurred in the sacred books they pronounced it, as they still do, 'Adonai' (i.e., Lord), thus using another word in its stead. The Massorets gave to it the vowel-points appropriate to this word. This Jewish practice was founded on a false interpretation of Lev. 24:16.

He has been described as 'a wild, daring, Gilead mountaineer, a sort of warrior Elijah.' After forty-five years of comparative quiet Israel again apostatized, and in 'process of time the children of Ammon made war against Israel' (11:5). In their distress the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob, to which he had fled when driven out wrongfully by his brothers from his father's inheritance (2), and the people made him their head and captain. The 'elders of Gilead' in their extremity summoned him to their aid, and he at once undertook the conduct of the war against Ammon. Twice he sent an embassy to the king of Ammon, but in vain. War was inevitable. The people obeyed his summons, and 'the spirit of the Lord came upon him.' Before engaging in war he vowed that if successful he would offer as a 'burnt-offering' whatever would come out of the door of his house first to meet him on his return. The defeat of the Ammonites was complete. 'He smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards [Heb. 'Abel Keramim], with a very great slaughter' (<r>Judg. 11:33</r>). The men of Ephraim regarded themselves as insulted in not having been called by Jephthah to go with him to war against Ammon. This led to a war between the men of Gilead and Ephraim (12:4), in which many of the Ephraimites perished.

This was a terrible blow to the victor, and in his despair he cried out, 'Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low...I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and cannot go back.' With singular nobleness of spirit she answered, 'Do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth.' She only asked two months to bewail her maidenhood with her companions upon the mountains. She utters no reproach against her father's rashness, and is content to yield her life since her father has returned a conqueror. But was it so? Did Jephthah offer up his daughter as a 'burnt-offering'? This question has been much debated, and there are many able commentators who argue that such a sacrifice was actually offered. We are constrained, however, by a consideration of Jephthah's known piety as a true worshipper of Jehovah, his evident acquaintance with the law of Moses, to which such sacrifices were abhorrent (<r>Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5; Deut. 12:31</r>), and the place he holds in the roll of the heroes of the faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews (11:32), to conclude that she was only doomed to a life of perpetual celibacy."},

Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he fled to Egypt (<r>1 Kings 11:29-40</r>), where he remained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed 'king of Israel' (<r>1 Kings 12: 1-20</r>). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, 'golden calves,' which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected.

She is the first great instigator of persecution against the saints of God. Guided by no principle, restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in her attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains to maintain idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four hundred and fifty prophets ministered under her care to Baal, besides four hundred prophets of the groves [R.V., 'prophets of the Asherah'], which ate at her table (<r>1 Kings 18:19</r>). The idolatry, too, was of the most debased and sensual kind.' Her conduct was in many respects very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah (21:1-29). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu rode into the gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the window of the palace, and said, 'Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?' He looked up and called to her chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so that she was dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses trod her under their feet.

Deborah was called to deliver Israel, but was already a judge.

In addition to the pardon (q.v.) of sin, justification declares that all the claims of the law are satisfied in respect of the justified. It is the act of a judge and not of a sovereign.

His address to his two wives, Adah and Zillah (4:23, 24), is the only extant example of antediluvian poetry. It has been called 'Lamech's sword-song.' He was 'rude and ruffianly,' fearing neither God nor man. With him the curtain falls on the race of Cain. We know nothing of his descendants."},
{i:2182,k:"Lamentation",t:"(Heb. qinah), an elegy or dirge. The first example of this form of poetry is the lament of David over Saul and Jonathan (<r>2 Sam. 1:17-27</r>). It was a frequent accompaniment of mourning (<r>Amos 8:10</r>). In 2 Sam. 3:33, 34 is recorded David's lament over Abner. Prophecy sometimes took the form of a lament when it predicted calamity (<r>Ezek. 27:2, 32; 28:12; 32:2, 16</r>)."},
{i:2183,k:"Lamentations, Book of",t:"called in the Hebrew canon _'Ekhah_, meaning 'How,' being the formula for the commencement of a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see 2 Sam. 1:19-27). The LXX. adopted the name rendered 'Lamentations' (Gr. threnoi = Heb. qinoth) now in common use, to denote the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on the city and the holy land by Chaldeans. In the Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Khethubim. (<see target='x-self'>See BIBLE.</see>)"},

{i:2186,k:"Laodicea",t:"The city of this name mentioned in Scripture lay on the confines of Phrygia and Lydia, about 40 miles east of Ephesus (<r>Rev. 3:14</r>), on the banks of the Lycus. It was originally called Diospolis and then Rhoas, but afterwards Laodicea, from Laodice, the wife of Antiochus II., king of Syria, who rebuilt it. It was one of the most important and flourishing cities of Asia Minor. At a very early period it became one of the chief seats of Christianity (<r>Col. 2:1; 4:15; Rev. 1:11, etc.</r>). It is now a deserted place, called by the Turks Eski-hissar or 'old castle.'"},

{i:2189,k:"Lapping",t:"of water like a dog, i.e., by putting the hand filled with water to the mouth. The dog drinks by shaping the end of his long thin tongue into the form of a spoon, thus rapidly lifting up water, which he throws into his mouth. The three hundred men that went with Gideon thus employed their hands and lapped the water out of their hands (<r>Judg. 7:7</r>)."},
{i:2190,k:"Lapwing",t:"the name of an unclean bird, mentioned only in Lev. 11:19 and Deut. 14:18. The Hebrew name of this bird, _dukiphath_, has been generally regarded as denoting the hoope (Upupa epops), an onomatopoetic word derived from the cry of the bird, which resembles the word 'hoop;' a bird not uncommon in Palestine. Others identify it with the English peewit."},

The Law of Nature is the will of God as to human conduct, founded on the moral difference of things, and discoverable by natural light (<r>Rom. 1:20; 2:14, 15</r>).

{i:2198,k:"Law of Moses",t:"is the whole body of the Mosaic legislation (<r>1 Kings 2:3; 2 Kings 23:25; Ezra 3:2</r>). It is called by way of eminence simply 'the Law' (Heb. Torah, Deut. 1:5; 4:8, 44; 17:18, 19; 27:3, 8). As a written code it is called the 'book of the law of Moses' (<r>2 Kings 14:6; Isa. 8:20</r>), the 'book of the law of God' (<r>Josh. 24:26</r>)."},
{i:2199,k:"Lawyer",t:"among the Jews, was one versed in the laws of Moses, which he expounded in the schools and synagogues (<r>Matt. 22:35; Luke 10:25</r>). The functions of the 'lawyer' and 'scribe' were identical. (<see target='x-self'>See DOCTOR.</see>)"},
{i:2200,k:"Lazarus",t:"an abbreviation of Eleazar, whom God helps. (1.) The brother of Mary and Martha of Bethany. He was raised from the dead after he had lain four days in the tomb (<r>John 11:1-44</r>). This miracle so excited the wrath of the Jews that they sought to put both Jesus and Lazarus to death."},
{i:2201,k:"Leaf",t:"of a tree. The olive-leaf mentioned Gen. 8:11. The barren fig-tree had nothing but leaves (<r>Matt. 21:19; Mark 11:13</r>). The oak-leaf is mentioned Isa. 1:30; 6:13. There are numerous allusions to leaves, their flourishing, their decay, and their restoration (<r>Lev. 26:36; Isa. 34:4; Jer. 8:13; Dan. 4:12, 14, 21; Mark 11:13; 13:28</r>). The fresh leaf is a symbol of prosperity (<r>Ps. 1:3; Jer. 17:8; Ezek. 47:12</r>); the faded, of decay (<r>Job 13:25; Isa. 1:30; 64:6; Jer. 8:13</r>)."},
{i:2202,k:"League",t:"a treaty or confederacy. The Jews were forbidden to enter into an alliance of any kind (1) with the Canaanites (<r>Ex. 23:32, 33; 34:12-16</r>); (2) with the Amalekites (<r>Ex. 17:8, 14; Deut. 25:17-19</r>); (3) with the Moabites and Ammonites (<r>Deut. 2:9, 19</r>). Treaties were permitted to be entered into with all other nations. Thus David maintained friendly intercourse with the kings of Tyre and Hamath, and Solomon with the kings of Tyre and Egypt."},
{i:2203,k:"Leah",t:"weary, the eldest daughter of Laban, and sister of Rachel (<r>Gen. 29:16</r>). Jacob took her to wife through a deceit of her father (<r>Gen. 29:23</r>). She was 'tender-eyed' (17). She bore to Jacob six sons (32-35), also one daughter, Dinah (30:21). She accompanied Jacob into Canaan, and died there before the time of the going down into Egypt (Gen. 31), and was buried in the cave of Machpelah (49:31)."},
{i:2204,k:"Leannoth",t:"for answering; i.e., in singing, occurs in the title to Ps. 88. The title 'Mahalath (q.v.) Leannoth' may be rendered 'concerning sickness, to be sung' i.e., perhaps, to be sung in sickness."},

Leather was employed both for clothing (<r>Num. 31:20; Heb. 11:37</r>) and for writing upon. The trade of a tanner is mentioned (<r>Acts 9:43; 10:6, 32</r>). It was probably learned in Egypt."},
{i:2207,k:"Leaven",t:"(1.) Heb. seor (<r>Ex. 12:15, 19; 13:7; Lev. 2:11</r>), the remnant of dough from the preceding baking which had fermented and become acid."},
{i:2208,k:"Lebanon",t:"white, 'the white mountain of Syria,' is the loftiest and most celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a branch running southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley (<r>Josh. 11:17</r>) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka'a, 'the valley,' a prolongation of the valley of the Jordan."},
{i:2209,k:"Lebbaeus",t:"courageous, a surname of Judas (Jude), one of the twelve (<r>Matt. 10:3</r>), called also Thaddaeus, not to be confounded with the Judas who was the brother of our Lord."},

This Hebrew word seems to denote in this last passage simply herbs, such as lettuce or savoury herbs cooked as kitchen vegetables, and not necessarily what are now called leeks. The leek was a favourite vegetable in Egypt, and is still largely cultivated there and in Palestine."},
{i:2212,k:"Lees",t:"(Heb. shemarim), from a word meaning to keep or preserve. It was applied to 'lees' from the custom of allowing wine to stand on the lees that it might thereby be better preserved (<r>Isa. 25:6</r>). 'Men settled on their lees' (<r>Zeph. 1:12</r>) are men 'hardened or crusted.' The image is derived from the crust formed at the bottom of wines long left undisturbed (<r>Jer. 48:11</r>). The effect of wealthy undisturbed ease on the ungodly is hardening. They become stupidly secure (<r>comp. Ps. 55:19; Amos 6:1</r>). To drink the lees (<r>Ps. 75:8</r>) denotes severe suffering."},
{i:2213,k:"Left hand",t:"among the Hebrews, denoted the north (<r>Job 23:9; Gen. 14:15</r>), the face of the person being supposed to be toward the east."},
{i:2214,k:"Left-handed",t:"(<r>Judg. 3:15; 20:16</r>), one unable to use the right hand skilfully, and who therefore uses the left; and also one who uses the left as well as the right, ambidexter. Such a condition of the hands is due to physical causes. This quality was common apparently in the tribe of Benjamin."},
{i:2215,k:"Legion",t:"a regiment of the Roman army, the number of men composing which differed at different times. It originally consisted of three thousand men, but in the time of Christ consisted of six thousand, exclusive of horsemen, who were in number a tenth of the foot-men.

The words in 15:19, 'a hollow place that was in the jaw' (A.V.), should be, as in Revised Version, 'the hollow place that is in Lehi.'"},
{i:2217,k:"Lemuel",t:"dedicated to God, a king whom his mother instructed (<r>Prov. 31:1-9</r>). Nothing is certainly known concerning him. The rabbis identified him with Solomon."},
{i:2218,k:"Lentiles",t:"(Heb. 'adashim), a species of vetch (<r>Gen. 25:34; 2 Sam. 23:11</r>), common in Syria under the name addas. The red pottage made by Jacob was of lentils (<r>Gen. 25:29-34</r>). They were among the provisions brought to David when he fled from Absalom (<r>2 Sam. 17:28</r>). It is the Ervum lens of Linnaeus, a leguminous plant which produces a fruit resembling a bean."},
{i:2219,k:"Leopard",t:"(Heb. namer, so called because spotted, Cant. 4:8), was that great spotted feline which anciently infested the mountains of Syria, more appropriately called a panther (Felis pardus). Its fierceness (<r>Isa. 11:6</r>), its watching for its prey (<r>Jer. 5:6</r>), its swiftness (<r>Hab. 1:8</r>), and the spots of its skin (<r>Jer. 13:23</r>), are noticed. This word is used symbolically (<r>Dan. 7:6; Rev. 13:2</r>)."},
{i:2220,k:"Leprosy",t:"(Heb. tsara'ath, a 'smiting,' a 'stroke,' because the disease was regarded as a direct providential infliction). This name is from the Greek lepra, by which the Greek physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We have the description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in Lev. 13; 14; Num. 12:10-15, etc. There were reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop itself, (1) without any apparent cause (<r>Lev. 13:2-8</r>); (2) its reappearance (9-17); (3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4) on the head or chin (29-37); (5) in white polished spots (38, 39); (6) at the back or in the front of the head (40-44)."},
{i:2221,k:"Letter",t:"in Rom. 2:27, 29 means the outward form. The 'oldness of the letter' (7:6) is a phrase which denotes the old way of literal outward obedience to the law as a system of mere external rules of conduct. In 2 Cor. 3:6, 'the letter' means the Mosaic law as a written law. (<see target='x-self'>See WRITING.</see>)"},
{i:2222,k:"Leummim",t:"peoples; nations, the last mentioned of the three sons of Dedan, and head of an Arabian tribe (<r>Gen. 25:3</r>)."},
{i:2223,k:"Levi",t:"adhesion. (1.) The third son of Jacob by Leah. The origin of the name is found in Leah's words (<r>Gen. 29:34</r>), 'This time will my husband be joined [Heb. yillaveh] unto me.' He is mentioned as taking a prominent part in avenging his sister Dinah (<r>Gen. 34:25-31</r>). He and his three sons went down with Jacob (46:11) into Egypt, where he died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years (<r>Ex. 6:16</r>)."},
{i:2224,k:"Leviathan",t:"a transliterated Hebrew word (livyathan), meaning 'twisted,' 'coiled.' In Job 3:8, Revised Version, and marg. of Authorized Version, it denotes the dragon which, according to Eastern tradition, is an enemy of light; in 41:1 the crocodile is meant; in Ps. 104:26 it 'denotes any large animal that moves by writhing or wriggling the body, the whale, the monsters of the deep.' This word is also used figuratively for a cruel enemy, as some think 'the Egyptian host, crushed by the divine power, and cast on the shores of the Red Sea' (<r>Ps. 74:14</r>). As used in Isa. 27:1, 'leviathan the piercing [R.V. 'swift'] serpent, even leviathan that crooked [R.V. marg. 'winding'] serpent,' the word may probably denote the two empires, the Assyrian and the Babylonian."},
{i:2225,k:"Levirate Law",t:"from Latin levir, 'a husband's brother,' the name of an ancient custom ordained by Moses, by which, when an Israelite died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to continue his brother's family through the son that might be born of that marriage (<r>Gen. 38:8; Deut. 25:5-10; comp. Ruth 3; 4:10</r>). Its object was 'to raise up seed to the departed brother.'"},
{i:2226,k:"Levite",t:"a descendant of the tribe of Levi (<r>Ex. 6:25; Lev. 25:32; Num. 35:2; Josh. 21:3, 41</r>). This name is, however, generally used as the title of that portion of the tribe which was set apart for the subordinate offices of the sanctuary service (<r>1 Kings 8:4; Ezra 2:70</r>), as assistants to the priests."},
{i:2227,k:"Leviticus",t:"the third book of the Pentateuch; so called in the Vulgate, after the LXX., because it treats chiefly of the Levitical service."},
{i:2228,k:"Levy",t:"(<r>1 Kings 4:6, R.V.; 5:13</r>), forced service. The service of tributaries was often thus exacted by kings. Solomon raised a 'great levy' of 30,000 men, about two per cent. of the population, to work for him by courses on Lebanon. Adoram (12:18) presided over this forced labour service (Ger. Frohndienst; Fr. corvee)."},
{i:2229,k:"Lewdness",t:"(<r>Acts 18:14</r>), villany or wickedness, not lewdness in the modern sense of the word. The word 'lewd' is from the Saxon, and means properly 'ignorant,' 'unlearned,' and hence low, vicious (<r>Acts 17:5</r>)."},
{i:2230,k:"Libertine",t:"found only Acts 6:9, one who once had been a slave, but who had been set at liberty, or the child of such a person. In this case the name probably denotes those descendants of Jews who had been carried captives to Rome as prisoners of war by Pompey and other Roman generals in the Syrian wars, and had afterwards been liberated. In A.D. 19 these manumitted Jews were banished from Rome. Many of them found their way to Jerusalem, and there established a synagogue."},

{i:2234,k:"Lice",t:"(Heb. kinnim), the creatures employed in the third plague sent upon Egypt (<r>Ex. 8:16-18</r>). They were miraculously produced from the dust of the land.

A terrible list of examples they have collected of the ravages of this and closely allied parasitic pests.' The plague of lice is referred to in Ps. 105:31."},
{i:2235,k:"Lie",t:"an intentional violation of the truth. Lies are emphatically condemned in Scripture (<r>John 8:44; 1 Tim. 1:9, 10; Rev. 21:27; 22:15</r>). Mention is made of the lies told by good men, as by Abraham (<r>Gen. 12:12, 13; 20:2</r>), Isaac (26:7), and Jacob (27:24); also by the Hebrew midwives (<r>Ex. 1:15-19</r>), by Michal (<r>1 Sam. 19:14</r>), and by David (<r>1 Sam. 20:6</r>).

{i:2236,k:"Kenath",t:"possession, a city of Gilead. It was captured by Nobah, who called it by his own name (<r>Num. 32:42</r>). It has been identified with Kunawat, on the slopes of Jebel Hauran (Mount Bashan), 60 miles east from the south end of the Sea of Galilee."},
{i:2237,k:"Kenaz",t:"hunter. (1.) One of the sons of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. He became the chief of an Edomitish tribe (<r>Gen. 36:11, 15, 42</r>)."},
{i:2238,k:"Kenites",t:"smiths, the name of a tribe inhabiting the desert lying between southern Palestine and the mountains of Sinai. Jethro was of this tribe (<r>Judg. 1:16</r>). He is called a 'Midianite' (<r>Num. 10:29</r>), and hence it is concluded that the Midianites and the Kenites were the same tribe. They were wandering smiths, 'the gipsies and travelling tinkers of the old Oriental world. They formed an important guild in an age when the art of metallurgy was confined to a few' (Sayce's Races, etc.). They showed kindness to Israel in their journey through the wilderness. They accompanied them in their march as far as Jericho (<r>Judg. 1:16</r>), and then returned to their old haunts among the Amalekites, in the desert to the south of Judah. They sustained afterwards friendly relations with the Israelites when settled in Canaan (<r>Judg. 4:11, 17-21; 1 Sam. 27:10; 30:29</r>). The Rechabites belonged to this tribe (<r>1 Chr. 2:55</r>) and in the days of Jeremiah (35:7-10) are referred to as following their nomad habits. Saul bade them depart from the Amalekites (<r>1 Sam. 15:6</r>) when, in obedience to the divine commission, he was about to 'smite Amalek.' And his reason is, 'for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.' Thus 'God is not unrighteous to forget the kindnesses shown to his people; but they shall be remembered another day, at the farthest in the great day, and recompensed in the resurrection of the just' (M. Henry's Commentary). They are mentioned for the last time in Scripture in 1 Sam. 27:10; comp. 30:20."},
{i:2239,k:"Kenizzite",t:"(1.) The name of a tribe referred to in the covenant God made with Abraham (<r>Gen. 15:19</r>). They are not mentioned among the original inhabitants of Canaan (<r>Ex. 3:8; Josh. 3:10</r>), and probably they inhabited some part of Arabia, in the confines of Syria."},
{i:2240,k:"Kerchief",t:"mentioned only Ezek. 13:18, 21, as an article of apparel or ornament applied to the head of the idolatrous women of Israel. The precise meaning of the word is uncertain. It appears to have been a long loose shawl, such as Oriental women wrap themselves in (<r>Ruth 3:15; Isa. 3:22</r>).

The Mosaic law forbade to dress a kid in the milk of its dam, a law which is thrice repeated (<r>Ex. 23:19; 34:26; Deut. 14:21</r>). Among the various reasons assigned for this law, that appears to be the most satisfactory which regards it as 'a protest against cruelty and outraging the order of nature.' A kid cooked in its mother's milk is 'a gross, unwholesome dish, and calculated to kindle animal and ferocious passions, and on this account Moses may have forbidden it. Besides, it is even yet associated with immoderate feasting; and originally, I suspect,' says Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book), 'was connected with idolatrous sacrifices.'"},

David crossed this brook bare-foot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom (<r>2 Sam. 15:23, 30</r>), and it was frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeyings to and fro (<r>John 18:1</r>). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his mother (<r>1 Kings 15:13</r>), and here Athaliah was executed (<r>2 Kings 11:16</r>). It afterwards became the receptacle for all manner of impurities (<r>2 Chr. 29:16; 30:14</r>); and in the time of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city (<r>2 Kings 23:6; comp.

After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab (<see target='x-self'>see MOABITE STONE</see>), threw off allegiance to the king of Israel, and fought successfully for the independence of his kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in seeking to regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom. The three kings led their armies against Mesha, who was driven back to seek refuge in Kir-haraseth. The Moabites were driven to despair. Mesha then took his eldest son, who would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of the allied armies.

It bears the modern name of Nahr el-Mokattah, i.e., 'the river of slaughter' (comp. 1 Kings 18:40). In the triumphal song of Deborah (<r>Judg. 5:21</r>) it is spoken of as 'that ancient river,' either (1) because it had flowed on for ages, or (2), according to the Targum, because it was 'the torrent in which were shown signs and wonders to Israel of old;' or (3) probably the reference is to the exploits in that region among the ancient Canaanites, for the adjoining plain of Esdraelon was the great battle-field of Palestine."},

Thus Moses commanded the holder of a pledge to stand without and call to the owner to come forth (<r>Deut. 24:10</r>). This was to avoid the violent intrusion of cruel creditors. Peter stood knocking at the outer door (<r>Acts 12:13, 16</r>), and the three men sent to Joppa by Cornelius made inquiry and 'stood before the gate' (10:17, 18).

They were attended by the sergeants (properly lictors or 'rod bearers')."},
{i:2308,k:"Magog",t:"region of Gog, the second of the 'sons' of Japheth (<r>Gen. 10:2; 1 Chr. 1:5</r>). In Ezekiel (38:2; 39:6) it is the name of a nation, probably some Scythian or Tartar tribe descended from Japheth. They are described as skilled horsemen, and expert in the use of the bow. The Latin father Jerome says that this word denotes 'Scythian nations, fierce and innumerable, who live beyond the Caucasus and the Lake Maeotis, and near the Caspian Sea, and spread out even onward to India.' Perhaps the name 'represents the Assyrian Mat Gugi, or 'country of Gugu,' the Gyges of the Greeks' (Sayce's Races, etc.)."},

Others regard this word 'mahalath' as the name simply of an old air to which the psalm was to be sung. Others, again, take the word as meaning 'sickness,' and regard it as alluding to the contents of the psalm."},
{i:2314,k:"Mahanaim",t:"two camps, a place near the Jabbok, beyond Jordan, where Jacob was met by the 'angels of God,' and where he divided his retinue into 'two hosts' on his return from Padan-aram (<r>Gen. 32:2</r>). This name was afterwards given to the town which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary of Bashan (<r>Josh. 13:26, 30</r>), and became a city of the Levites (21:38). Here Saul's son Ishbosheth reigned (<r>2 Sam. 2:8, 12</r>), while David reigned at Hebron. Here also, after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth was murdered by two of his own bodyguard (<r>2 Sam. 4:5-7</r>), who brought his head to David at Hebron, but were, instead of being rewarded, put to death by him for their cold-blooded murder. Many years after this, when he fled from Jerusalem on the rebellion of his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where Barzillai entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his forces which were led against the army that had gathered around Absalom. It was while sitting at the gate of this town that tidings of the great and decisive battle between the two hosts and of the death of his son Absalom reached him, when he gave way to the most violent grief (<r>2 Sam. 17:24-27</r>)."},
{i:2315,k:"Mahaneh-dan",t:"Judg. 18:12 = 'camp of Dan' 13:25 (R.V., 'Mahaneh-dan'), a place behind (i.e., west of) Kirjath-jearim, where the six hundred Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol encamped on their way to capture the city of Laish, which they rebuilt and called 'Dan, after the name of their father' (18:11-31).

They were put to death by Joshua, who afterwards suspended their bodies upon five trees. It has been identified with the modern village called Sumeil, standing on a low hill about 7 miles to the north-west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin), where are ancient remains and a great cave. The Palestine Exploration surveyors have, however, identified it with el-Mughar, or 'the caves,' 3 miles from Jabneh and 2 1/2 southwest of Ekron, because, they say, 'at this site only of all possible sites for Makkedah in the Palestine plain do caves still exist.'

{i:2327,k:"Malachi",t:"messenger or angel, the last of the minor prophets, and the writer of the last book of the Old Testament canon (<r>Mal. 4:4, 5, 6</r>). Nothing is known of him beyond what is contained in his book of prophecies. Some have supposed that the name is simply a title descriptive of his character as a messenger of Jehovah, and not a proper name. There is reason, however, to conclude that Malachi was the ordinary name of the prophet."},
{i:2328,k:"Malachi, Prophecies of",t:"The contents of the book are comprised in four chapters. In the Hebrew text the third and fourth chapters (of the A.V.) form but one. The whole consists of three sections, preceded by an introduction (<r>Mal. 1:1-5</r>), in which the prophet reminds Israel of Jehovah's love to them. The first section (1:6-2:9) contains a stern rebuke addressed to the priests who had despised the name of Jehovah, and been leaders in a departure from his worship and from the covenant, and for their partiality in administering the law. In the second (2:9-16) the people are rebuked for their intermarriages with idolatrous heathen. In the third (2:17-4:6) he addresses the people as a whole, and warns them of the coming of the God of judgment, preceded by the advent of the Messiah."},

Light came also naturally to typify true religion and the felicity it imparts (<r>Ps. 119:105; Isa. 8:20; Matt. 4:16, etc.</r>), and the glorious inheritance of the redeemed (<r>Col. 1:12; Rev. 21:23-25</r>). God is said to dwell in light inaccessible (<r>1 Tim. 6:16</r>). It frequently signifies instruction (<r>Matt. 5:16; John 5:35</r>). In its highest sense it is applied to Christ as the 'Sun of righteousness' (<r>Mal. 4:2; Luke 2:32; John 1:7-9</r>). God is styled 'the Father of lights' (<r>James 1:17</r>). It is used of angels (<r>2 Cor. 11:14</r>), and of John the Baptist, who was a 'burning and a shining light' (<r>John 5:35</r>), and of all true disciples, who are styled 'the light of the world' (<r>Matt. 5:14</r>)."},

The 'ligurite' is so named from Liguria in Italy, where it was found."},
{i:2344,k:"Lily",t:"The Hebrew name shushan or shoshan, i.e., 'whiteness', was used as the general name of several plants common to Syria, such as the tulip, iris, anemone, gladiolus, ranunculus, etc. Some interpret it, with much probability, as denoting in the Old Testament the water-lily (Nymphoea lotus of Linn.), or lotus (<r>Cant. 2:1, 2; 2:16; 4:5; 5:13; 6:2, 3; 7:2</r>). 'Its flowers are large, and they are of a white colour, with streaks of pink. They supplied models for the ornaments of the pillars and the molten sea' (<r>1 Kings 7:19, 22, 26; 2 Chr. 4:5</r>). In the Canticles its beauty and fragrance shadow forth the preciousness of Christ to the Church. Groser, however (Scrip. Nat. Hist.), strongly argues that the word, both in the Old and New Testaments, denotes liliaceous plants in general, or if one genus is to be selected, that it must be the genus Iris, which is 'large, vigorous, elegant in form, and gorgeous in colouring.'"},
{i:2345,k:"Lime",t:"The Hebrew word so rendered means 'boiling' or 'effervescing.' From Isa. 33:12 it appears that lime was made in a kiln lighted by thorn-bushes. In Amos 2:1 it is recorded that the king of Moab 'burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.' The same Hebrew word is used in Deut. 27:2-4, and is there rendered 'plaster.' Limestone is the chief constituent of the mountains of Syria."},

To 'open the lips' is to begin to speak (<r>Job 11:5</r>); to 'refrain the lips' is to keep silence (<r>Ps. 40:9; 1 Pet. 3:10</r>). The 'fruit of the lips' (<r>Heb. 13:15</r>) is praise, and the 'calves of the lips' thank-offerings (<r>Hos. 14:2</r>). To 'shoot out the lip' is to manifest scorn and defiance (<r>Ps. 22:7</r>). Many similar forms of expression are found in Scripture."},
{i:2352,k:"Litter",t:"(Heb. tsab, as being lightly and gently borne), a sedan or palanquin for the conveyance of persons of rank (<r>Isa. 66:20</r>).

In Ezek. 21:21 there is allusion, in the statement that the king of Babylon 'looked upon the liver,' to one of the most ancient of all modes of divination. The first recorded instance of divination (q.v.) is that of the teraphim of Laban. By the teraphim the LXX. and Josephus understood 'the liver of goats.' By the 'caul above the liver,' in Lev. 4:9; 7:4, etc., some understand the great lobe of the liver itself."},

At the end of seven years all debts were remitted. Of a foreigner the loan might, however, be exacted. At a later period of the Hebrew commonwealth, when commerce increased, the practice of exacting usury or interest on loans, and of suretiship in the commercial sense, grew up. Yet the exaction of it from a Hebrew was regarded as discreditable (<r>Ps. 15:5; Prov. 6:1, 4; 11:15; 17:18; 20:16; 27:13; Jer. 15:10</r>)."},

{i:2370,k:"Lot",t:"(Heb. goral, a 'pebble'), a small stone used in casting lots (<r>Num. 33:54; Jonah 1:7</r>). The lot was always resorted to by the Hebrews with strictest reference to the interposition of God, and as a method of ascertaining the divine will (<r>Prov. 16:33</r>), and in serious cases of doubt (<r>Esther 3:7</r>). Thus the lot was used at the division of the land of Canaan among the serveral tribes (<r>Num. 26:55; 34:13</r>), at the detection of Achan (<r>Josh. 7:14, 18</r>), the election of Saul to be king (<r>1 Sam. 10:20, 21</r>), the distribution of the priestly offices of the temple service (<r>1 Chr. 24:3, 5, 19; Luke 1:9</r>), and over the two goats at the feast of Atonement (<r>Lev. 16:8</r>).

When our Lord says, 'Lovest thou me?' he uses the Greek word _agapas_; and when Simon answers, he uses the Greek word _philo_, i.e., 'I love.' This is the usage in the first and second questions put by our Lord; but in the third our Lord uses Simon's word. The distinction between these two Greek words is thus fitly described by Trench:, '_Agapan_ has more of judgment and deliberate choice; _philein_ has more of attachment and peculiar personal affection. Thus the 'Lovest thou' (Gr. agapas) on the lips of the Lord seems to Peter at this moment too cold a word, as though his Lord were keeping him at a distance, or at least not inviting him to draw near, as in the passionate yearning of his heart he desired now to do. Therefore he puts by the word and substitutes his own stronger 'I love' (Gr. philo) in its room. A second time he does the same. And now he has conquered; for when the Lord demands a third time whether he loves him, he does it in the word which alone will satisfy Peter ('Lovest thou,' Gr. phileis), which alone claims from him that personal attachment and affection with which indeed he knows that his heart is full.'"},

According to his own statement (<r>Luke 1:2</r>), he was not an 'eye-witness and minister of the word from the beginning.' It is probable that he was a physician in Troas, and was there converted by Paul, to whom he attached himself. He accompanied him to Philippi, but did not there share his imprisonment, nor did he accompany him further after his release in his missionary journey at this time (<r>Acts 17:1</r>). On Paul's third visit to Philippi (20:5, 6) we again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the intervening time in that city, a period of seven or eight years. From this time Luke was Paul's constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem (20:6-21:18). He again disappears from view during Paul's imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome (27:1), whither he accompanies him (28:2, 12-16), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment (<r>Philemon 1:24; Col. 4:14</r>).

The 'speech of Lycaonia' (<r>Acts 14:11</r>) was probably the ancient Assyrian language, or perhaps, as others think, a corrupt Greek intermingled with Syriac words.

It lay about 9 miles east of Joppa, on the road from the sea-port to Jerusalem. In the Old Testament (<r>1 Chr. 8:12</r>) it is called Lod.

His letter to his superior officer is an interesting specimen of Roman military correspondence (23:26-30). He obtained his Roman citizenship by purchase, and was therefore probably a Greek. (See CLAUDIUS"},
{i:2392,k:"Lystra",t:"a town of Lycaonia, in Asia Minor, in a wild district and among a rude population. Here Paul preached the gospel after he had been driven by persecution from Iconium (<r>Acts 14:2-7</r>). Here also he healed a lame man (8), and thus so impressed the ignorant and superstitious people that they took him for Mercury, because he was the 'chief speaker,' and his companion Barnabas for Jupiter, probably in consequence of his stately, venerable appearance; and were proceeding to offer sacrifices to them (13), when Paul earnestly addressed them and turned their attention to the true source of all blessings. But soon after, through the influence of the Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium, they stoned Paul and left him for dead (14:19). On recovering, Paul left for Derbe; but soon returned again, through Lystra, encouraging the disciples there to steadfastness. He in all likelihood visited this city again on his third missionary tour (<r>Acts 18:23</r>). Timothy, who was probably born here (<r>2 Tim. 3:10, 11</r>), was no doubt one of those who were on this occasion witnesses of Paul's persecution and his courage in Lystra."},

{i:2398,k:"Man",t:"(1.) Heb. 'Adam, used as the proper name of the first man. The name is derived from a word meaning 'to be red,' and thus the first man was called Adam because he was formed from the red earth. It is also the generic name of the human race (<r>Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:2; 8:21; Deut. 8:3</r>). Its equivalents are the Latin homo and the Greek anthropos (<r>Matt. 5:13, 16</r>).

He and his brother Ephraim were afterwards adopted by Jacob as his own sons (48:1). There is an account of his marriage to a Syrian (<r>1 Chr. 7:14</r>); and the only thing afterwards recorded of him is, that his grandchildren were 'brought up upon Joseph's knees' (<r>Gen. 50:23; R.V., 'born upon Joseph's knees'</r>) i.e., were from their birth adopted by Joseph as his own children."},

It has been rendered 'violets,' 'Lilies,' 'jasmines,' 'truffles or mushrooms,' 'flowers,' the 'citron,' etc. The weight of authority is in favour of its being regarded as the Mandragora officinalis of botanists, 'a near relative of the night-shades, the 'apple of Sodom' and the potato plant.' It possesses stimulating and narcotic properties (<r>Gen. 30:14-16</r>). The fruit of this plant resembles the potato-apple in size, and is of a pale orange colour.

It seems to have been a stall or crib for feeding cattle. Stables and mangers in our modern sense were in ancient times unknown in the East.

{i:2405,k:"Manna",t:"Heb. man-hu, 'What is that?' the name given by the Israelites to the food miraculously supplied to them during their wanderings in the wilderness (<r>Ex. 16:15-35</r>). The name is commonly taken as derived from _man_, an expression of surprise, 'What is it?' but more probably it is derived from _manan_, meaning 'to allot,' and hence denoting an 'allotment' or a 'gift.' This 'gift' from God is described as 'a small round thing,' like the 'hoar-frost on the ground,' and 'like coriander seed,' 'of the colour of bdellium,' and in taste 'like wafers made with honey.' It was capable of being baked and boiled, ground in mills, or beaten in a mortar (<r>Ex. 16:23; Num. 11:7</r>). If any was kept over till the following morning, it became corrupt with worms; but as on the Sabbath none fell, on the preceding day a double portion was given, and that could be kept over to supply the wants of the Sabbath without becoming corrupt. Directions concerning the gathering of it are fully given (<r>Ex. 16:16-18, 33; Deut. 8:3, 16</r>). It fell for the first time after the eighth encampment in the desert of Sin, and was daily furnished, except on the Sabbath, for all the years of the wanderings, till they encamped at Gilgal, after crossing the Jordan, when it suddenly ceased, and where they 'did eat of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more' (<r>Josh. 5:12</r>).

On this account they murmured against Moses, who, under divine direction, cast into the fountain 'a certain tree' which took away its bitterness, so that the people drank of it.

Dar, some regard as Parian marble. It is here rendered 'white marble.' But nothing is certainly known of it. (3.) Bahat, 'red marble,' probably the verd-antique or half-porphyry of Egypt. (4.) Sohareth, 'black marble,' probably some spotted variety of marble. 'The marble pillars and tesserae of various colours of the palace at Susa came doubtless from Persia itself, where marble of various colours is found, especially in the province of Hamadan Susiana.'

After the first circle have satisfied themselves, those lower in honour sit down to the rest, the whole company being men, for women are never seen at a feast. Water is poured on the hands before eating; and this is repeated when the meal closes, the fingers having first been wiped on pieces of bread, which, after serving the same purpose as table-napkins with us, are thrown on the ground to be eaten by any dog that may have stolen in from the streets through the ever-open door, or picked up by those outside when gathered and tossed out to them (<r>Matt. 15:27; Mark 7:28</r>). Rising from the ground and retiring to the seats round the walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and gossip, or listen to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being scantily supplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by a smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room, perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor.

In the distribution of the oxen and waggons offered by the princes (Num. 7), Moses gave twice as many to the Merarites (four waggons and eight oxen) as he gave to the Gershonites, because the latter had to carry only the lighter furniture of the tabernacle, such as the curtains, hangings, etc., while the former had to carry the heavier portion, as the boards, bars, sockets, pillars, etc., and consequently needed a greater supply of oxen and waggons.

After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them (<r>Num. 22:4-7</r>). Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished (<r>Num. 25:9</r>). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed (<r>Josh. 13:21, 22</r>).

On the other hand, it is maintained, more in accordance with the teaching of Scripture, we think, that Christ's second advent will not be premillennial, and that the right conception of the prospects and destiny of his kingdom is that which is taught, e.g., in the parables of the leaven and the mustard-seed. The triumph of the gospel, it is held, must be looked for by the wider and more efficient operation of the very forces that are now at work in extending the gospel; and that Christ will only come again at the close of this dispensation to judge the world at the 'last day.' The millennium will thus precede his coming."},

Probably the Canaanite name of some fortification, consisting of walls filled in with earth and stones, which protected Jerusalem on the north as its outermost defence. It is always rendered Akra i.e., 'the citadel', in the LXX. It was already existing when David conquered Jerusalem (<r>2 Sam. 5:9</r>). He extended it to the right and left, thus completing the defence of the city. It was rebuilt by Solomon (<r>1 Kings 9:15, 24; 11:27</r>) and repaired by Hezekiah (<r>2 Chr. 32:5</r>)."},

It was much used in domestic economy as a condiment, and also as a medicine. The paying of tithes of mint was in accordance with the Mosiac law (<r>Deut. 14:22</r>), but the error of the Pharisees lay in their being more careful about this little matter of the mint than about weightier matters."},

In David's conduct on that occasion she saw nothing but a needless humiliation of the royal dignity (<r>1 Chr. 15:29</r>). She remained childless, and thus the races of David and Saul were not mixed. In 2 Sam. 21:8 her name again occurs, but the name Merab should probably be here substituted for Michal (comp. 1 Sam. 18:19)."},

It lay on the line of march of an invading army from the north, on the north side of the steep and precipitous Wady es-Suweinit ('valley of the little thorn-tree' or 'the acacia'), and now bears the name of Mukhmas. This wady is called 'the passage of Michmash' (<r>1 Sam. 13:23</r>).

The root of the word means to stamp or grave, and hence it is regarded as denoting a composition so precious as to be worthy to be engraven on a durable tablet for preservation; or, as others render, 'a psalm precious as stamped gold,' from the word _kethem_, 'fine or stamped gold.'"},

For four years there was continued opposition to his reign, Tibni, another claimant to the throne, leading the opposing party; but at the close of that period all his rivals were defeated, and he became king of Israel, 'Tibni died and Omri reigned' (B.C. 927). By his vigour and power he gained great eminence and consolidated the kingdom. He fixed his dynasty on the throne so firmly that it continued during four succeeding reigns. Tirza was for six years the seat of his government. He then removed the capital to Samaria (q.v.), where he died, and was succeeded by his son Ahab.

The Vulgate and the LXX. Versions have 'Heliopolis' ('city of the sun') instead of On in Genesis and of Aven in Ezekiel. The 'city of destruction' Isaiah speaks of (19:18, marg. 'of Heres;' Heb. 'Ir-ha-heres, which some MSS. read Ir-ha-heres, i.e., 'city of the sun') may be the name given to On, the prophecy being that the time will come when that city which was known as the 'city of the sun-god' shall become the 'city of destruction' of the sun-god, i.e., when idolatry shall cease, and the worship of the true God be established."},

In the New Testament it is used only in the plural, and always denotes the Word of God (<r>Rom. 3:2; Heb. 5:12, etc.</r>). The Scriptures are called 'living oracles' (<r>comp.

The Vulgate renders thus, but the LXX. renders by Hesperus, i.e., 'the evening-star,' Venus. The Orientals 'appear to have conceived of this constellation under the figure of an impious giant bound upon the sky.' This giant was, according to tradition, Nimrod, the type of the folly that contends against God. In Isa. 13:10 the plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered 'constellations.'"},

'When the other vultures have picked the flesh off any animal, he comes in at the end of the feast, and swallows the bones, or breaks them, and swallows the pieces if he cannot otherwise extract the marrow. The bones he cracks [hence the appropriateness of the name ossifrage, i.e., 'bone-breaker'] by letting them fall on a rock from a great height. He does not, however, confine himself to these delicacies, but whenever he has an opportunity will devour lambs, kids, or hares. These he generally obtains by pushing them over cliffs, when he has watched his opportunity; and he has been known to attack men while climbing rocks, and dash them against the bottom. But tortoises and serpents are his ordinary food...No doubt it was a lammer-geier that mistook the bald head of the poet AEschylus for a stone, and dropped on it the tortoise which killed him' (Tristram's Nat.

In Job 39:13 this word in the Authorized Version is the rendering of a Hebrew word (notsah) which means 'feathers,' as in the Revised Version. In the same verse the word 'peacocks' of the Authorized Version is the rendering of the Hebrew pl. renanim, properly meaning 'ostriches,' as in the Revised Version.

It was set up by Mesha as a record and memorial of his victories. It records (1) Mesha's wars with Omri, (2) his public buildings, and (3) his wars against Horonaim.

{i:2644,k:"Moses",t:"drawn (or Egypt. mesu, 'son;' hence Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh (<r>Gen. 45:17-25</r>), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd's life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the 'best of the land', the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or 'shepherd' king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis)."},
{i:2645,k:"Mote",t:"(Gr. karphos, something dry, hence a particle of wood or chaff, etc.). A slight moral defect is likened to a mote (<r>Matt. 7:3-5; Luke 6:41, 42</r>)."},

{i:2647,k:"Mouldy",t:"Of the Gibeonites it is said that 'all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy' (<r>Josh. 9:5, 12</r>). The Hebrew word here rendered 'mouldy' (nikuddim) is rendered 'cracknels' in 1 Kings 14:3, and denotes a kind of crisp cake. The meaning is that the bread of the Gibeonites had become dry and hard, hard as biscuits, and thus was an evidence of the length of the journey they had travelled."},
{i:2648,k:"Mount",t:"Palestine is a hilly country (<r>Deut. 3:25; 11:11; Ezek. 34:13</r>). West of Jordan the mountains stretch from Lebanon far down into Galilee, terminating in Carmel. The isolated peak of Tabor rises from the elevated plain of Esdraelon, which, in the south, is shut in by hills spreading over the greater part of Samaria. The mountains of Western and Middle Palestine do not extend to the sea, but gently slope into plains, and toward the Jordan fall down into the Ghor."},

{i:2653,k:"Mount of the congregation",t:"only in Isa. 14:13, a mythic mountain of the Babylonians, regarded by them as the seat of the gods. It was situated in the far north, and in Babylonian inscriptions is described as a mountain called Im-Kharasak, 'the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head reaches heaven, whose root is the holy deep.' In their geography they are said to have identified it with mount El-wend, near Ecbatana."},
{i:2654,k:"Mount of the valley",t:"(<r>Josh. 13:19</r>), a district in the east of Jordan, in the territory of Reuben. The 'valley' here was probably the Ghor or valley of the Jordan, and hence the 'mount' would be the hilly region in the north end of the Dead Sea. (See ZARETH-SHAHAR"},
{i:2655,k:"Mourn",t:"Frequent references are found in Scripture to, (1.) Mourning for the dead. Abraham mourned for Sarah (<r>Gen. 23:2</r>); Jacob for Joseph (37:34, 35); the Egyptians for Jacob (50:3-10); Israel for Aaron (<r>Num. 20:29</r>), for Moses (<r>Deut. 34:8</r>), and for Samuel (<r>1 Sam. 25:1</r>); David for Abner (<r>2 Sam. 3:31, 35</r>); Mary and Martha for Lazarus (John 11); devout men for Stephen (<r>Acts 8:2</r>), etc."},
{i:2656,k:"Mouse",t:"Heb. 'akhbar, 'swift digger'), properly the dormouse, the field-mouse (<r>1 Sam. 6:4</r>). In Lev. 11:29, Isa. 66:17 this word is used generically, and includes the jerboa (Mus jaculus), rat, hamster (Cricetus), which, though declared to be unclean animals, were eaten by the Arabs, and are still eaten by the Bedouins. It is said that no fewer than twenty-three species of this group ('akhbar=Arab. ferah) of animals inhabit Palestine. God 'laid waste' the people of Ashdod by the terrible visitation of field-mice, which are like locusts in their destructive effects (<r>1 Sam. 6:4, 11, 18</r>). Herodotus, the Greek historian, accounts for the destruction of the army of Sennacherib (<r>2 Kings 19:35</r>) by saying that in the night thousands of mice invaded the camp and gnawed through the bow-strings, quivers, and shields, and thus left the Assyrians helpless. (See SENNACHERIB"},
{i:2657,k:"Mowing",t:"(Heb. gez), rendered in Ps. 72:6 'mown grass.' The expression 'king's mowings' (<r>Amos 7:1</r>) refers to some royal right of early pasturage, the first crop of grass for the cavalry (comp. 1 Kings 18:5)."},

{i:2661,k:"Mulberry",t:"Heb. bakah, 'to weep;' rendered 'Baca' (R.V., 'weeping') in Ps. 84:6. The plural form of the Hebrew bekaim is rendered 'mulberry trees' in 2 Sam. 5:23, 24 and 1 Chr. 14:14, 15. The tree here alluded to was probably the aspen or trembling poplar. 'We know with certainty that the black poplar, the aspen, and the Lombardy poplar grew in Palestine. The aspen, whose long leaf-stalks cause the leaves to tremble with every breath of wind, unites with the willow and the oak to overshadow the watercourses of the Lebanon, and with the oleander and the acacia to adorn the ravines of Southern Palestine' (Kitto). By 'the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees' we are to understand a rustling among the trees like the marching of an army. This was the signal that the Lord himself would lead forth David's army to victory. (<see target='x-self'>See SYCAMINE.</see>)"},
{i:2662,k:"Mule",t:"(Heb. pered), so called from the quick step of the animal or its power of carrying loads. It is not probable that the Hebrews bred mules, as this was strictly forbidden in the law (<r>Lev. 19:19</r>), although their use was not forbidden. We find them in common use even by kings and nobles (<r>2 Sam. 18:9; 1 Kings 1:33; 2 Kings 5:17; Ps. 32:9</r>). They are not mentioned, however, till the time of David, for the word rendered 'mules' (R.V. correctly, 'hot springs') in Gen. 36:24 (yemim) properly denotes the warm springs of Callirhoe, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. In David's reign they became very common (<r>2 Sam. 13:29; 1 Kings 10:25</r>)."},
{i:2663,k:"Murder",t:"Wilful murder was distinguished from accidental homicide, and was invariably visited with capital punishment (<r>Num. 35:16, 18, 21, 31; Lev. 24:17</r>). This law in its principle is founded on the fact of man's having been made in the likeness of God (<r>Gen. 9:5, 6; John 8:44; 1 John 3:12, 15</r>). The Mosiac law prohibited any compensation for murder or the reprieve of the murderer (<r>Ex. 21:12, 14; Deut. 19:11, 13; 2 Sam. 17:25; 20:10</r>). Two witnesses were required in any capital case (<r>Num. 35:19-30; Deut. 17:6-12</r>). If the murderer could not be discovered, the city nearest the scene of the murder was required to make expiation for the crime committed (<r>Deut. 21:1-9</r>). These offences also were to be punished with death, (1) striking a parent; (2) cursing a parent; (3) kidnapping (<r>Ex. 21:15-17; Deut. 27:16</r>)."},

{i:2665,k:"Murrain",t:"Heb. deber, 'destruction,' a 'great mortality', the fifth plague that fell upon the Egyptians (<r>Ex. 9:3</r>).

{i:2667,k:"Music",t:"Jubal was the inventor of musical instruments (<r>Gen. 4:21</r>). The Hebrews were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of Laban's interview with Jacob (<r>Gen. 31:27</r>). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance (Ex. 15)."},
{i:2668,k:"Music, Instrumental",t:"Among instruments of music used by the Hebrews a principal place is given to stringed instruments. These were, (1.) The kinnor, the 'harp.' (2.) The nebel, 'a skin bottle,' rendered 'psaltery.' (3.) The sabbeka, or 'sackbut,' a lute or lyre. (4.) The gittith, occurring in the title of Ps. 8; 8; 84. (5.) Minnim (<r>Ps. 150:4</r>), rendered 'stringed instruments;' in Ps. 45:8, in the form _minni_, probably the apocopated (i.e., shortened) plural, rendered, Authorized Version, 'whereby,' and in the Revised Version 'stringed instruments.' (6.) Machalath, in the titles of Ps. 53 and 88; supposed to be a kind of lute or guitar."},
{i:2669,k:"Musician, Chief",t:"(Heb. menatstseah), the precentor of the Levitical choir or orchestra in the temple, mentioned in the titles of fifty-five psalms, and in Hab. 3:19, Revised Version. The first who held this office was Jeduthun (<r>1 Chr. 16:41</r>), and the office appears to have been hereditary. Heman and Asaph were his two colleagues (<r>2 Chr. 35:15</r>)."},
{i:2670,k:"Mustard",t:"a plant of the genus sinapis, a pod-bearing, shrub-like plant, growing wild, and also cultivated in gardens. The little round seeds were an emblem of any small insignificant object. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament; and in each of the three instances of its occurrence in the New Testament (<r>Matt. 13:31, 32; Mark 4:31, 32; Luke 13:18, 19</r>) it is spoken of only with reference to the smallness of its seed. The common mustard of Palestine is the Sinapis nigra. This garden herb sometimes grows to a considerable height, so as to be spoken of as 'a tree' as compared with garden herbs."},
{i:2671,k:"Muth-labben",t:"occurring only in the title of Psalm 9. Some interpret the words as meaning 'on the death of Labben,' some unknown person. Others render the word, 'on the death of the son;' i.e., of Absalom (<r>2 Sam. 18:33</r>).

It was used in embalming (<r>John 19:39</r>), also as a perfume (<r>Esther 2:12; Ps. 45:8; Prov. 7:17</r>). It was a custom of the Jews to give those who were condemned to death by crucifixion 'wine mingled with myrrh' to produce insensibility.

There are many near Bethlehem and about Hebron, especially near Dewir Dan, the ancient Debir.

He was afflicted with leprosy; and when the little Hebrew slave-girl that waited on his wife told her of a prophet in Samaria who could cure her master, he obtained a letter from Benhadad and proceeded with it to Joram. The king of Israel suspected in this some evil design against him, and rent his clothes. Elisha the prophet hearing of this, sent for Naaman, and the strange interview which took place is recorded in 2 Kings 5. The narrative contains all that is known of the Syrian commander. He was cured of his leprosy by dipping himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha. His cure is alluded to by our Lord (<r>Luke 4:27</r>)."},

During his wanderings David came into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about to shear his sheep, he sent ten of his young men to ask 'whatsoever cometh unto thy hand for thy servants.' Nabal insultingly resented the demand, saying, 'Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?' (<r>1 Sam. 25:10, 11</r>). One of the shepherds that stood by and saw the reception David's messengers had met with, informed Abigail, Nabal's wife, who at once realized the danger that threatened her household. She forthwith proceeded to the camp of David, bringing with her ample stores of provisions (25:18).

Naboth, however, refused on any terms to part with it to the king. He had inherited it from his fathers, and no Israelite could lawfully sell his property (<r>Lev. 25:23</r>). Jezebel, Ahab's wife, was grievously offended at Naboth's refusal to part with his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his death. His sons also shared his fate (<r>2 Kings 9:26; 1 Kings 21:19</r>). She then came to Ahab and said, 'Arise, take possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.' Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which had so treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly enjoying his new possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly appeared before him and pronounced against him a fearful doom (<r>1 Kings 21:17-24</r>). Jehu and Bidcar were with Ahab at this time, and so deeply were the words of Elijah imprinted on Jehu's memory that many years afterwards he refers to them (<r>2 Kings 9:26</r>), and he was the chief instrument in inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their house (9:30-37).

The exact year or month or day of his birth cannot, however, now be exactly ascertained. We know, however, that it took place in the 'fulness of the time' (<r>Gal. 4:4</r>), i.e., at the fittest time in the world's history.

When this Greek designation was at first applied to our Lord, it was meant simply to denote the place of his residence. In course of time the word became a term of reproach. Thus the word 'Nazarene' carries with it an allusion to those prophecies which speak of Christ as 'despised of men' (<r>Isa. 53:3</r>). Some, however, think that in this name there is an allusion to the Hebrew _netser_, which signifies a branch or sprout. It is so applied to the Messiah (<r>Isa. 11:1</r>), i.e., he whom the prophets called the _Netse_, the 'Branch.'"},
{i:2718,k:"Nazareth",t:"separated, generally supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew _netser_, a 'shoot' or 'sprout.' Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew _notserah_, i.e., one guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which overlooks and thus guards an extensive region."},
{i:2719,k:"Nazarite",t:"(Heb. form Nazirite), the name of such Israelites as took on them the vow prescribed in Num. 6:2-21. The word denotes generally one who is separated from others and consecrated to God. Although there is no mention of any Nazarite before Samson, yet it is evident that they existed before the time of Moses. The vow of a Nazarite involved these three things, (1) abstinence from wine and strong drink, (2) refraining from cutting the hair off the head during the whole period of the continuance of the vow, and (3) the avoidance of contact with the dead."},

Here a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was slain (<r>2 Chr. 35:20-24</r>). Possibly, as some suppose, Necho may have brought his army by sea to some port to the north of Dor (<r>comp. Josh. 11:2; 12:23</r>), a Phoenician town at no great distance from Megiddo. After this battle Necho marched on to Carchemish (q.v.), where he met and conquered the Assyrian army, and thus all the Syrian provinces, including Palestine, came under his dominion."},
{i:2731,k:"Neck",t:"used sometimes figuratively. To 'lay down the neck' (<r>Rom. 16:4</r>) is to hazard one's life. Threatenings of coming judgments are represented by the prophets by their laying bands upon the people's necks (<r>Deut. 28:48; Isa. 10:27; Jer. 27:2</r>).

Some interpret the expression as referring to the side gate, close to the principal gate, usually called the 'eye of a needle' in the East; but it is rather to be taken literally. The Hebrew females were skilled in the use of the needle (<r>Ex. 28:39; 26:36; Judg. 5:30</r>)."},
{i:2735,k:"Neginah",t:"in the title of Ps. 61, denotes the music of stringed instruments (<r>1 Sam. 16:16; Isa. 38:20</r>). It is the singular form of Neginoth."},

It is supposed that these portions may have been written by Ezra; of this, however, there is no distinct evidence.

The lapse of nearly one thousand years had invested the 'brazen serpent' with a mysterious sanctity; and in order to deliver the people from their infatuation, and impress them with the idea of its worthlessness, Hezekiah called it, in contempt, 'Nehushtan,' a brazen thing, a mere piece of brass (<r>2 Kings 18:4</r>)."},
{i:2743,k:"Neiel",t:"dwelling-place of God, a town in the territory of Asher, near its southern border (<r>Josh. 19:27</r>). It has been identified with the ruin Y'anin, near the outlet of the Wady esh Sha-ghur, less than 2 miles north of Kabul, and 16 miles east of Caesarea."},

{i:2752,k:"Nero",t:"occurs only in the superscription (which is probably spurious, and is altogether omitted in the R.V.) to the Second Epistle to Timothy. He became emperor of Rome when he was about seventeen years of age (A.D. 54), and soon began to exhibit the character of a cruel tyrant and heathen debauchee. In May A.D. 64, a terrible conflagration broke out in Rome, which raged for six days and seven nights, and totally destroyed a great part of the city. The guilt of this fire was attached to him at the time, and the general verdict of history accuses him of the crime. 'Hence, to suppress the rumour,' says Tacitus (Annals, xv. 44), 'he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished with the most exquisite tortures, the persons commonly called Christians, who are hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of that name, was put to death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius; but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only throughout Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, whither all things horrible and disgraceful flow, from all quarters, as to a common receptacle, and where they are encouraged. Accordingly, first three were seized, who confessed they were Christians. Next, on their information, a vast multitude were convicted, not so much on the charge of burning the city as of hating the human race. And in their deaths they were also made the subjects of sport; for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and, when day declined, burned to serve for nocturnal lights. Nero offered his own gardens for that spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the habit of a charioteer, or else standing in his chariot; whence a feeling of compassion arose toward the sufferers, though guilty and deserving to be made examples of by capital punishment, because they seemed not to be cut off for the public good, but victims to the ferocity of one man.' Another Roman historian, Suetonius (Nero, xvi.), says of him: 'He likewise inflicted punishments on the Christians, a sort of people who hold a new and impious superstition' (Forbes's Footsteps of St. Paul, p. 60)."},
{i:2753,k:"Net",t:"in use among the Hebrews for fishing, hunting, and fowling. The fishing-net was probably constructed after the form of that used by the Egyptians (<r>Isa. 19:8</r>). There were three kinds of nets. (1.) The drag-net or hauling-net (Gr. sagene), of great size, and requiring many men to work it. It was usually let down from the fishing-boat, and then drawn to the shore or into the boat, as circumstances might require (<r>Matt. 13:47, 48</r>). (2.) The hand-net or casting-net (Gr. amphiblestron), which was thrown from a rock or a boat at any fish that might be seen (<r>Matt. 4:18; Mark 1:16</r>). It was called by the Latins funda. It was of circular form, 'like the top of a tent.' (3.) The bag-net (Gr. diktyon), used for enclosing fish in deep water (<r>Luke 5:4-9</r>)."},

{i:2756,k:"Nethinim",t:"the name given to the hereditary temple servants in all the post-Exilian books of Scripture. The word means given, i.e., 'those set apart', viz., to the menial work of the sanctuary for the Levites.

The tradition is that the Gibeonites (<r>Josh. 9:27</r>) were the original caste, afterwards called Nethinim. Their numbers were added to afterwards from captives taken in battle; and they were formally given by David to the Levites (<r>Ezra 8:20</r>), and so were called Nethinim, i.e., the given ones, given to the Levites to be their servants. Only 612 Nethinim returned from Babylon (<r>Ezra 2:58; 8:20</r>). They were under the control of a chief from among themselves (2:43; Neh. 7:46).

He is next met with in the Sanhedrin (7:50-52), where he protested against the course they were taking in plotting against Christ. Once more he is mentioned as taking part in the preparation for the anointing and burial of the body of Christ (<r>John 19:39</r>). We hear nothing more of him.

The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against this city. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold (<r>Nah.1:14; 3:19, etc.</r>). Zephaniah also (2:13-15) predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital.

In Ezek. 30:14, 16 it is simply called 'No;' but in ver. 15 the name has the Hebrew Hamon prefixed to it, 'Hamon No.' This prefix is probably the name simply of the god usually styled Amon or Ammon.

But according to Isa. 10:28-32 it was on the south of Geba, on the road to Jerusalem, and within sight of the city. This identification does not meet these conditions, and hence others (as Dean Stanley) think that it was the northern summit of Mount Olivet, the place where David 'worshipped God' when fleeing from Absalom (<r>2 Sam. 15:32</r>), or more probably (Conder) that it was the same as Mizpeh (q.v.), Judg. 20:1; Josh. 18:26; 1 Sam. 7:16, at Nebi Samwil, about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem."},

Ahab seems to have held Obadiah in great honour, although he had no sympathy with his piety (5, 6, 7).

It is now a ruined village, called Philibedjik. Philip of Macedonia fortified the old Thracian town of Crenides, and called it after his own name Philippi (B.C. 359-336). In the time of the Emperor Augustus this city became a Roman colony, i.e., a military settlement of Roman soldiers, there planted for the purpose of controlling the district recently conquered. It was a 'miniature Rome,' under the municipal law of Rome, and governed by military officers, called duumviri, who were appointed directly from Rome. Having been providentially guided thither, here Paul and his companion Silas preached the gospel and formed the first church in Europe. (<see target='x-self'>See LYDIA.</see>) This success stirred up the enmity of the people, and they were 'shamefully entreated' (<r>Acts 16:9-40; 1 Thess. 2:2</r>).

Some suppose them to have been a branch of the Rephaim (<r>2 Sam. 21:16-22</r>). In the time of Abraham they inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being their king (<r>Gen. 21:32, 34; 26:1</r>). They are, however, not noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the Pentateuch. They are spoken of by Amos (9:7) and Jeremiah (47:4) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some think, the Delta of Egypt. In the whole record from Exodus to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract of country which lay between Judea and Egypt (<r>Ex. 13:17; 15:14, 15; Josh. 13:3; 1 Sam. 4</r>)."},

For his faithfulness on that occasion he received the divine approbation (10-13). He afterwards commanded the army that went out against the Midianites (31:6-8). When representatives of the people were sent to expostulate with the two and a half tribes who, just after crossing Jordan, built an altar and departed without giving any explanation, Phinehas was their leader, and addressed them in the words recorded in Josh. 22:16-20. Their explanation follows. This great altar was intended to be all ages only a witness that they still formed a part of Israel. Phinehas was afterwards the chief adviser in the war with the Benjamites. He is commemorated in Ps. 106:30, 31. (See ED"},

Deut. 6:4-9; (4.) 11:18-21, and which were enclosed in a square leather case, on one side of which was inscribed the Hebrew letter shin, to which the rabbis attached some significance.

Some have identified it with Ajrud, a fortress between Etham and Suez. The condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus is not exactly known, and hence this, with the other places mentioned as encampments of Israel in Egypt, cannot be definitely ascertained. The isthmus has been formed by the Nile deposits. This increase of deposit still goes on, and so rapidly that within the last fifty years the mouth of the Nile has advanced northward about four geographical miles.

He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a 'typical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns.'"},

It has been argued (Dr. Lansing) that these 'store' cities 'were residence cities, royal dwellings, such as the Pharaohs of old, the Kings of Israel, and our modern Khedives have ever loved to build, thus giving employment to the superabundant muscle of their enslaved peoples, and making a name for themselves.'"},

Pardon is an act of a sovereign, in pure sovereignty, granting simply a remission of the penalty due to sin, but securing neither honour nor reward to the pardoned. Justification (q.v.), on the other hand, is the act of a judge, and not of a sovereign, and includes pardon and, at the same time, a title to all the rewards and blessings promised in the covenant of life."},
{i:2911,k:"Parlour",t:"(from the Fr. parler, 'to speak') denotes an 'audience chamber,' but that is not the import of the Hebrew word so rendered. It corresponds to what the Turks call a kiosk, as in Judg. 3:20 (the 'summer parlour'), or as in the margin of the Revised Version ('the upper chamber of cooling'), a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze, and having a door communicating with the outside by which persons seeking an audience may be admitted. While Eglon was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretence of having a message from God to him, was admitted into his presence, and murderously plunged his dagger into his body (21, 22)."},

This bird, unlike our own partridge, is distinguished by 'its ringing call-note, which in early morning echoes from cliff to cliff amidst the barrenness of the wilderness of Judea and the glens of the forest of Carmel' hence its Hebrew name. This name occurs only twice in Scripture."},

At this time the _nagid_, or 'governor,' of the temple was Seraiah the high priest (<r>1 Chr. 6:14</r>), and Pashur was his _paqid_, or 'deputy.' Enraged at the plainness with which Jeremiah uttered his solemn warnings of coming judgements, because of the abounding iniquity of the times, Pashur ordered the temple police to seize him, and after inflicting on him corporal punishment (forty stripes save one, Deut. 25:3; comp. 2 Cor. 11:24), to put him in the stocks in the high gate of Benjamin, where he remained all night. On being set free in the morning, Jeremiah went to Pashur (<r>Jer. 20:3, 5</r>), and announced to him that God had changed his name to Magor-missabib, i.e., 'terror on every side.' The punishment that fell upon him was probably remorse, when he saw the ruin he had brought upon his country by advising a close alliance with Egypt in opposition to the counsels of Jeremiah (20:4-6). He was carried captive to Babylon, and died there."},
{i:2922,k:"Passage",t:"denotes in Josh. 22:11, as is generally understood, the place where the children of Israel passed over Jordan. The words 'the passage of' are, however, more correctly rendered 'by the side of,' or 'at the other side of,' thus designating the position of the great altar erected by the eastern tribes on their return home. This word also designates the fords of the Jordan to the south of the Sea of Galilee (<r>Judg. 12:5, 6</r>), and a pass or rocky defile (<r>1 Sam. 13:23; 14:4</r>). 'Passages' in Jer. 22:20 is in the Revised Version more correctly 'Abarim' (q.v.), a proper name."},

{i:2924,k:"Passover",t:"the name given to the chief of the three great historical annual festivals of the Jews. It was kept in remembrance of the Lord's passing over the houses of the Israelites (<r>Ex. 12:13</r>) when the first born of all the Egyptians were destroyed. It is called also the 'feast of unleavened bread' (<r>Ex. 23:15; Mark 14:1; Acts 12:3</r>), because during its celebration no leavened bread was to be eaten or even kept in the household (<r>Ex. 12:15</r>). The word afterwards came to denote the lamb that was slain at the feast (<r>Mark 14:12-14; 1 Cor. 5:7</r>)."},
{i:2925,k:"Patara",t:"a city on the south-west coast of Lycia at which Paul landed on his return from his third missionary journey (<r>Acts 21:1, 2</r>).

{i:2927,k:"Patmos",t:"a small rocky and barren island, one of the group called the 'Sporades,' in the AEgean Sea. It is mentioned in Scripture only in Rev. 1:9. It was on this island, to which John was banished by the emperor Domitian (A.D. 95), that he received from God the wondrous revelation recorded in his book. This has naturally invested it with the deepest interest for all time. It is now called Patmo. (<see target='x-self'>See JOHN.</see>)"},
{i:2928,k:"Patriarch",t:"a name employed in the New Testament with reference to Abraham (<r>Heb. 7:4</r>), the sons of Jacob (<r>Acts 7:8, 9</r>), and to David (2:29). This name is generally applied to the progenitors of families or 'heads of the fathers' (<r>Josh. 14:1</r>) mentioned in Scripture, and they are spoken of as antediluvian (from Adam to Noah) and post-diluvian (from Noah to Jacob) patriachs. But the expression 'the patriarch,' by way of eminence, is applied to the twelve sons of Jacob, or to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."},

His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy 'for use in the Gentile world,' as 'Saul' would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants."},
{i:2932,k:"Pavement",t:"It was the custom of the Roman governors to erect their tribunals in open places, as the market-place, the circus, or even the highway. Pilate caused his seat of judgment to be set down in a place called 'the Pavement' (<r>John 19:13</r>) i.e., a place paved with a mosaic of coloured stones. It was probably a place thus prepared in front of the 'judgment hall.' (See GABBATHA"},

{i:2935,k:"Peacock",t:"(Heb. tuk, apparently borrowed from the Tamil tokei). This bird is indigenous to India. It was brought to Solomon by his ships from Tarshish (<r>1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:21</r>), which in this case was probably a district on the Malabar coast of India, or in Ceylon. The word so rendered in Job 39:13 literally means wild, tumultuous crying, and properly denotes the female ostrich (q.v.)."},

{i:2937,k:"Peculiar",t:"as used in the phrase 'peculiar people' in 1 Pet. 2:9, is derived from the Lat. peculium, and denotes, as rendered in the Revised Version ('a people for God's own possession'), a special possession or property.

Seventeen years after this he entered into an alliance with Rezin, king of Syria, and took part with him in besieging Jerusalem (<r>2 Kings 15:37; 16:5</r>). But Tiglath-pilser, who was in alliance with Ahaz, king of Judah, came up against Pekah, and carried away captive many of the inhabitants of his kingdom (<r>2 Kings 15:29</r>). This was the beginning of the 'Captivity.' Soon after this Pekah was put to death by Hoshea, the son of Elah, who usurped the throne (<r>2 Kings 15:30; 16:1-9. Comp. Isa. 7:16; 8:4; 9:12</r>).

He was murdered in the royal palace of Samaria by Pekah, one of the captains of his army (<r>2 Kings 15:23-26</r>), after a reign of two years (B.C. 761-759). He 'did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.'"},
{i:2943,k:"Pekod",t:"probably a place in Babylonia (<r>Jer. 50:21; Ezek. 23:23</r>). It is the opinion, however, of some that this word signifies 'visitation,' 'punishment,' and allegorically 'designates Babylon as the city which was to be destroyed.'"},

{i:2949,k:"Pelethites",t:"mentioned always along with the Cherethites, and only in the time of David.

Some, however, think that these are the names simply of two Philistine tribes from which David selected his body-guard.

It is of an enormous size, being about 6 feet long, with wings stretching out over 12 feet. The Hebrew name (kaath, i.e., 'vomiter') of this bird is incorrectly rendered 'cormorant' in the Authorized Version of Isa. 34:11 and Zeph. 2:14, but correctly in the Revised Version. It receives its Hebrew name from its habit of storing in its pouch large quantities of fish, which it disgorges when it feeds its young. Two species are found on the Syrian coast, the Pelicanus onocrotalus, or white pelican, and the Pelicanus crispus, or Dalmatian pelican."},

It is thus rendered in the New Testament, and is more frequently mentioned than any other coin (<r>Matt. 18:28; 20:2, 9, 13; Mark 6:37; 14:5, etc.</r>). It was the daily pay of a Roman soldier in the time of Christ. In the reign of Edward III. an English penny was a labourer's day's wages. This was the 'tribute money' with reference to which our Lord said, 'Whose image and superscription is this?' When they answered, 'Caesar's,' he replied, 'Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's' (<r>Matt. 22:19; Mark 12:15</r>)."},

This word does not occur in Scripture, nor is it certainly known when the roll was thus divided into five portions Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Probably that was done by the LXX. translators. Some modern critics speak of a Hexateuch, introducing the Book of Joshua as one of the group. But this book is of an entirely different character from the other books, and has a different author. It stands by itself as the first of a series of historical books beginning with the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan. (<see target='x-self'>See JOSHUA.</see>)"},
{i:2953,k:"Pentecost",t:"i.e., 'fiftieth', found only in the New Testament (<r>Acts 2:1; 20:16; 1 Cor. 16:8</r>). The festival so named is first spoken of in Ex. 23:16 as 'the feast of harvest,' and again in Ex. 34:22 as 'the day of the firstfruits' (<r>Num. 28:26</r>). From the sixteenth of the month of Nisan (the second day of the Passover), seven complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine days, were to be reckoned, and this feast was held on the fiftieth day. The manner in which it was to be kept is described in Lev. 23:15-19; Num. 28:27-29. Besides the sacrifices prescribed for the occasion, every one was to bring to the Lord his 'tribute of a free-will offering' (<r>Deut. 16:9-11</r>). The purpose of this feast was to commemorate the completion of the grain harvest. Its distinguishing feature was the offering of 'two leavened loaves' made from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering."},

When he looked on the tribes encamped in the acacia groves below him, he could not refrain from giving utterance to a remarkable benediction (24:1-9). Balak was more than ever enraged at Balaam, and bade him flee for his life. But before he went he gave expression to that wonderful prediction regarding the future of this mysterious people, whose 'goodly tents' were spread out before him, and the coming of a 'Star' out of Jacob and a 'Sceptre' out of Israel (24:14-17)."},

Paul and his companions landed at this place from Cyprus on their first missionary journey (<r>Acts 13:13, 14</r>), and here Mark forsook the party and returned to Jerusalem. Some time afterwards Paul and Barnabas again visited this city and 'preached the word' (14:25).

Ahab's example in this respect was followed by Manasseh, who 'shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another' (<r>2 Kings 21:16; comp. 24:4</r>).

They were Aryans, their language belonging to the eastern division of the Indo-European group. One of their chiefs, Teispes, conquered Elam in the time of the decay of the Assyrian Empire, and established himself in the district of Anzan. His descendants branched off into two lines, one line ruling in Anzan, while the other remained in Persia. Cyrus II., king of Anzan, finally united the divided power, conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and carried his arms into the far East. His son, Cambyses, added Egypt to the empire, which, however, fell to pieces after his death.

His native town was Bethsaida, on the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip belonged. Here he was brought up by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and was trained to the occupation of a fisher. His father had probably died while he was still young, and he and his brother were brought up under the care of Zebedee and his wife Salome (<r>Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40; 16:1</r>). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew, James, and John, spent their boyhood and early manhood in constant fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed all the advantages of a religious training, and were early instructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with the great prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. They did not probably enjoy, however, any special training in the study of the law under any of the rabbis.

It also contains (3:15, 16) a remarkable reference to Paul's epistles. Some think this reference is to 1 Thess. 4:13-5:11. A few years ago, among other documents, a parchment fragment, called the 'Gospel of Peter,' was discovered in a Christian tomb at Akhmim in Upper Egypt. Origen (obiit A.D. 254), Eusebius (obiit 340), and Jerome (obiit 420) refer to such a work, and hence it has been concluded that it was probably written about the middle of the second century. It professes to give a history of our Lord's resurrection and ascension. While differing in not a few particulars from the canonical Gospels, the writer shows plainly that he was acquinted both with the synoptics and with the Gospel of John. Though apocryphal, it is of considerable value as showing that the main facts of the history of our Lord were then widely known."},

In Ps. 45:9, the Hebrew for 'queen' is not _malkah_, one actually ruling like the Queen of Sheba, but _shegal_, which simply means the king's wife. In 1 Kings 11:19, Pharaoh's wife is called 'the queen,' but the Hebrew word so rendered (g'birah) is simply a title of honour, denoting a royal lady, used sometimes for 'queen-mother' (<r>1 Kings 15:13; 2 Chron. 15:16</r>). In Cant. 6:8, 9, the king's wives are styled 'queens' (Heb. melakhoth)."},

Here the bedstead of Og was preserved (<r>Deut. 3:11</r>), perhaps as a trophy of some victory gained by the Ammonites over the king of Bashan. After David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he sent Joab with a strong force to take their city. For two years it held out against its assailants. It was while his army was engaged in this protracted siege that David was guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At length, having taken the 'royal city' (or the 'city of waters,' 2 Sam. 12:27, i.e., the lower city on the river, as distinguished from the citadel), Joab sent for David to direct the final assault (11:1; 12:26-31). The city was given up to plunder, and the people were ruthlessly put to death, and 'thus did he with all the cities of the children of Ammon.' The destruction of Rabbath was the last of David's conquests. His kingdom now reached its farthest limits (<r>2 Sam. 8:1-15; 1 Chr. 18:1-15</r>).

Afterwards, on Jacob's departure from Mesopotamia, she took with her her father's teraphim (31:34, 35). As they journeyed on from Bethel, Rachel died in giving birth to Benjamin (35:18, 19), and was buried 'in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave'.

The 'early' or 'former' rains commence in autumn in the latter part of October or beginning of November (<r>Deut. 11:14; Joel 2:23; comp. Jer. 3:3</r>), and continue to fall heavily for two months. Then the heavy 'winter rains' fall from the middle of December to March. There is no prolonged fair weather in Palestine between October and March. The 'latter' or spring rains fall in March and April, and serve to swell the grain then coming to maturity (<r>Deut. 11:14; Hos. 6:3</r>).

The slave or captive is not liberated by a mere gratuitous favour, but a ransom price has been paid, in consideration of which he is set free. The original owner receives back his alienated and lost possession because he has bought it back 'with a price.' This price or ransom (Gr. lutron) is always said to be Christ, his blood, his death.

The main body of the Kenites dwelt in cities, and adopted settled habits of life (30:29); but Jehonadab forbade his descendants to drink wine or to live in cities. They were commanded to lead always a nomad life. They adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab, and were noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of their family in the days of Jeremiah (35); and this feature of their character is referred to by the prophet for the purpose of giving point to his own exhortation.

They are 150 feet distant from each other, and each pool is 20 feet lower than that above it, the conduits being so arranged that the lowest, which is the largest and finest of the three, is filled first, and then in succession the others. It has been estimated that these pools cover in all a space of about 7 acres, and are capable of containing three million gallons of water. They were, as is generally supposed, constructed in the days of Solomon. They are probably referred to in Eccles. 2:6. On the fourth day after his victory over the Ammonites, etc., in the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat assembled his army in the valley of Berachah ('blessing'), and there blessed the Lord. Berachah has been identified with the modern Bereikut, some 5 miles south of Wady Urtas, and hence the 'valley of Berachah' may be this valley of pools, for the word means both 'blessing' and 'pools;' and it has been supposed, therefore, that this victory was celebrated beside Solomon's pools (<r>2 Chr. 20:26</r>)."},

Such messengers were used from very early times. Those employed by the Hebrew kings had a military character (<r>1 Sam. 22:17; 2 Kings 10:25, 'guard,' marg. 'runners'</r>).

He was 'captain of the guard', i.e., chief, probably, of the state police, who, while they formed part of the Egyptian army, were also largely employed in civil duties (37:36; marg., 'chief of the executioners'). Joseph, though a foreigner, gradually gained his confidence, and became overseer over all his possessions.

This is properly a military word. It denotes (1) the general's tent or headquarters; (2) the governor's residence, as in Acts 23:35 (R.V., 'palace'); and (3) the praetorian guard (<see target='x-self'>See PALACE</see>), or the camp or quarters of the praetorian cohorts (<r>Acts 28:16</r>), the imperial guards in immediate attendance on the emperor, who was 'praetor' or commander-in-chief."},

Prayer may be oral or mental, occasional or constant, ejaculatory or formal.

The Greek word rendered 'predestinate' is found only in these six passages, Acts 4:28; Rom. 8:29, 30; 1 Cor. 2:7; Eph. 1:5, 11; and in all of them it has the same meaning.

{i:3050,k:"Prince",t:"the title generally applied to the chief men of the state. The 'princes of the provinces' (<r>1 Kings 20:14</r>) were the governors or lord-lieutenants of the provinces. So also the 'princes' mentioned in Dan. 6:1, 3, 4, 6, 7 were the officers who administered the affairs of the provinces; the 'satraps' (as rendered in R.V.). These are also called 'lieutenants' (<r>Esther 3:12; 8:9; R.V., 'satraps'</r>). The promised Saviour is called by Daniel (9:25) 'Messiah the Prince' (Heb. nagid); compare Acts 3:15; 5:31. The angel Micheal is called (<r>Dan. 12:1</r>) a 'prince' (Heb. sar, whence 'Sarah,' the 'princes')."},

Then Potiphar, 'Joseph's master, took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound' (<r>Gen. 39:20-23</r>). The Heb. word here used (sohar) means properly a round tower or fortress. It seems to have been a part of Potiphar's house, a place in which state prisoners were kept."},
{i:3053,k:"Prophecy",t:"or prediction, was one of the functions of the prophet.

{i:3054,k:"Prophet",t:"(Heb. nabi, from a root meaning 'to bubble forth, as from a fountain,' hence 'to utter', comp. Ps. 45:1). This Hebrew word is the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, _ro'eh_, 'seer', began to be used (<r>1 Sam. 9:9</r>). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word, _hozeh_, 'seer' (<r>2 Sam. 24:11</r>), was employed. In 1 Ch. 29:29 all these three words are used: 'Samuel the seer (ro'eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi'), Gad the seer' (hozeh). In Josh. 13:22 Balaam is called (Heb.) a _kosem_ 'diviner,' a word used only of a false prophet."},
{i:3055,k:"Propitiation",t:"that by which God is rendered propitious, i.e., by which it becomes consistent with his character and government to pardon and bless the sinner. The propitiation does not procure his love or make him loving; it only renders it consistent for him to execise his love towards sinners."},
{i:3056,k:"Proportion of faith",t:"(<r>Rom. 12:6</r>). Paul says here that each one was to exercise his gift of prophecy, i.e., of teaching, 'according to the proportion of faith.' The meaning is, that the utterances of the 'prophet' were not to fluctuate according to his own impulses or independent thoughts, but were to be adjusted to the truth revealed to him as a beliver, i.e., were to be in accordance with it."},
{i:3057,k:"Proselyte",t:"is used in the LXX. for 'stranger' (<r>1 Chr. 22:2</r>), i.e., a comer to Palestine; a sojourner in the land (<r>Ex. 12:48; 20:10; 22:21</r>), and in the New Testament for a convert to Judaism. There were such converts from early times (<r>Isa. 56:3; Neh. 10:28; Esther 8:17</r>). The law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into the Jewish church of such as were not born Israelites (<r>Ex. 20:10; 23:12; 12:19, 48; Deut. 5:14; 16:11, 14, etc.</r>). The Kenites, the Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites were thus admitted to the privileges of Israelites. Thus also we hear of individual proselytes who rose to positions of prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah the Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah and Ebedmelech the Ethiopians."},
{i:3058,k:"Proverb",t:"a trite maxim; a similitude; a parable. The Hebrew word thus rendered (mashal) has a wide signification. It comes from a root meaning 'to be like,' 'parable.' Rendered 'proverb' in Isa. 14:4; Hab. 2:6; 'dark saying' in Ps. 49:4, Num. 12:8. Ahab's defiant words in answer to the insolent demands of Benhadad, 'Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off,' is a well known instance of a proverbial saying (<r>1 Kings 20:11</r>)."},
{i:3059,k:"Proverbs, Book of",t:"a collection of moral and philosophical maxims of a wide range of subjects presented in a poetic form. This book sets forth the 'philosophy of practical life. It is the sign to us that the Bible does not despise common sense and discretion. It impresses upon us in the most forcible manner the value of intelligence and prudence and of a good education. The whole strength of the Hebrew language and of the sacred authority of the book is thrown upon these homely truths. It deals, too, in that refined, discriminating, careful view of the finer shades of human character so often overlooked by theologians, but so necessary to any true estimate of human life' (Stanley's Jewish Church)."},
{i:3060,k:"Providence",t:"literally means foresight, but is generally used to denote God's preserving and governing all things by means of second causes (<r>Ps. 18:35; 63:8; Acts 17:28; Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3</r>). God's providence extends to the natural world (<r>Ps. 104:14; 135:5-7; Acts 14:17</r>), the brute creation (<r>Ps. 104:21-29; Matt. 6:26; 10:29</r>), and the affairs of men (<r>1 Chr. 16:31; Ps. 47:7; Prov. 21:1; Job 12:23; Dan. 2:21; 4:25</r>), and of individuals (<r>1 Sam. 2:6; Ps. 18:30; Luke 1:53; James 4:13-15</r>). It extends also to the free actions of men (<r>Ex. 12:36; 1 Sam. 24:9-15; Ps. 33:14, 15; Prov. 16:1; 19:21; 20:24; 21:1</r>), and things sinful (<r>2 Sam. 16:10; 24:1; Rom. 11:32; Acts 4:27, 28</r>), as well as to their good actions (<r>Phil. 2:13; 4:13; 2 Cor. 12:9, 10; Eph. 2:10; Gal. 5:22-25</r>)."},
{i:3061,k:"Psalms",t:"The psalms are the production of various authors. 'Only a portion of the Book of Psalms claims David as its author. Other inspired poets in successive generations added now one now another contribution to the sacred collection, and thus in the wisdom of Providence it more completely reflects every phase of human emotion and circumstances than it otherwise could.' But it is specially to David and his contemporaries that we owe this precious book. In the 'titles' of the psalms, the genuineness of which there is no sufficient reason to doubt, 73 are ascribed to David. Peter and John (<r>Acts 4:25</r>) ascribe to him also the second psalm, which is one of the 48 that are anonymous. About two-thirds of the whole collection have been ascribed to David."},

The Hebrew word nebhel, so rendered, is translated 'viol' in Isa. 5:12 (R.V., 'lute'); 14:11. In Dan. 3:5, 7, 10, 15, the word thus rendered is Chaldaic, pesanterin, which is supposed to be a word of Greek origin denoting an instrument of the harp kind."},

In order to collect the taxes, the publicans employed subordinates (5:27; 15:1; 18:10), who, for their own ends, were often guilty of extortion and peculation. In New Testament times these taxes were paid to the Romans, and hence were regarded by the Jews as a very heavy burden, and hence also the collectors of taxes, who were frequently Jews, were hated, and were usually spoken of in very opprobrious terms. Jesus was accused of being a 'friend of publicans and sinners' (<r>Luke 7:34</r>)."},

{i:3068,k:"Pul",t:"(1.) An Assyrian king. It has been a question whether he was identical with Tiglath-pileser III. (q.v.), or was his predecessor. The weight of evidence is certainly in favour of their identity. Pul was the throne-name he bore in Babylonia as king of Babylon, and Tiglath-pileser the throne-name he bore as king of Assyria. He was the founder of what is called the second Assyrian empire. He consolidated and organized his conquests on a large scale. He subdued Northern Syria and Hamath, and the kings of Syria rendered him homage and paid him tribute. His ambition was to found in Western Asia a kingdom which should embrace the whole civilized world, having Nineveh as its centre. Menahem, king of Israel, gave him the enormous tribute of a thousand talents of silver, 'that his hand might be with him' (<r>2 Kings 15:19; 1 Chr. 5:26</r>). The fact that this tribute could be paid showed the wealthy condition of the little kingdom of Israel even in this age of disorder and misgovernment. Having reduced Syria, he turned his arms against Babylon, which he subdued. The Babylonian king was slain, and Babylon and other Chaldean cities were taken, and Pul assumed the title of 'King of Sumer [i.e., Shinar] and Accad.' He was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV."},

Punishment proceeds on the principle that there is an eternal distinction between right and wrong, and that this distinction must be maintained for its own sake. It is not primarily intended for the reformation of criminals, nor for the purpose of deterring others from sin. These results may be gained, but crime in itself demands punishment.

God 'rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea' (<r>Ps. 78:27</r>). The words in Num. 11:31, according to the Authorized Version, appear to denote that the quails lay one above another to the thickness of two cubits above the ground. The Revised Version, however, reads, 'about two cubits above the face of the earth', i.e., the quails flew at this height, and were easily killed or caught by the hand.

Out of these mammoth caverns stones, a hard lime-stone, have been quarried in ancient times for the buildings in the city, and for the temples of Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Herod. Huge blocks of stone are still found in these caves bearing the marks of pick and chisel. The general appearance of the whole suggests to the explorer the idea that the Phoenician quarrymen have just suspended their work. The supposition that the polished blocks of stone for Solomon's temple were sent by Hiram from Lebanon or Tyre is not supported by any evidence (comp. 1 Kings 5:8). Hiram sent masons and stone-squarers to Jerusalem to assist Solomon's workmen in their great undertaking, but did not send stones to Jerusalem, where, indeed, they were not needed, as these royal quarries abundantly testify."},

Some have argued that the crossing took place opposite the Wady Tawarik, where the sea is at present some 7 miles broad.

It was he also who pledged his life and the life of his sons when Jacob was unwilling to let Benjamin go down into Egypt.

This tribe united with that of Gad in asking permission to settle in the 'land of Gilead,' 'on the other side of Jordan' (32:1-5). The lot assigned to Reuben was the smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes. It extended from the Arnon, in the south along the coast of the Dead Sea to its northern end, where the Jordan flows into it (<r>Josh. 13:15-21, 23</r>).

As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to 'make streets in Samaria', i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. 'It was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone.

During the twenty years following this he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life. Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with the last twenty years of Eli's life. After this we have an account of his exploits at Gaza (16:1-3), and of his infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery (16:4-20), and then of his melancholy death (16:21-31).

Here his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life passed away.

When it is said (<r>Isa. 13:21; comp. 34:14</r>) 'the satyrs shall dance there,' the meaning is that the place referred to shall become a desolate waste.

They tried their method of exorcism on a fierce demoniac, and failed. His answer to them was to this effect (19:15): 'The Jesus whom you invoke is One whose authority I acknowledge; and the Paul whom you name I recognize to be a servant or messenger of God; but what sort of men are ye who have been empowered to act as you do by neither?'

Hence the pedagogue was stern and severe in his discipline. Thus the law was a pedagogue to the Jews, with a view to Christ, i.e., to prepare for faith in Christ by producing convictions of guilt and helplessness.

It was God's purpose thus to perpetuate his revealed will. From time to time he raised up men to commit to writing in an infallible record the revelation he gave. The 'Scripture,' or collection of sacred writings, was thus enlarged from time to time as God saw necessary. We have now a completed 'Scripture,' consisting of the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament canon in the time of our Lord was precisely the same as that which we now possess under that name.

It was capable of containing two or three thousand baths of water (comp. 2 Chr. 4:5), which was originally supplied by the Gibeonites, but was afterwards brought by a conduit from the pools of Bethlehem. It was made of 'brass' (copper), which Solomon had taken from the captured cities of Hadarezer, the king of Zobah (<r>1 Chr. 18:8</r>).

He first set himself to break up the powerful combination of princes who were in league against him. Among these was Hezekiah, who had entered into an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. He accordingly led a very powerful army of at least 200,000 men into Judea, and devastated the land on every side, taking and destroying many cities (<r>2 Kings 18:13-16; comp. Isa. 22, 24, 29, and 2 Chr. 32:1-8</r>).

From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, asses and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape...Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and divers treasures, a rich and immense booty...All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government.'

Others identify it with Sardis, the capital of Lydia. The Latin father Jerome regarded it as an Assyrian word, meaning 'boundary,' and interpreted the sentence, 'which is in Sepharad,' by 'who are scattered abroad in all the boundaries and regions of the earth.'

In Acts 7:16 it is said that Jacob was 'laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.' It has been proposed, as a mode of reconciling the apparent discrepancy between this verse and Gen. 23:20, to read Acts 7:16 thus: 'And they [i.e., our fathers] were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor [the son] of Sychem.'

The word 'purely' in Isa. 1:25 (R.V., 'throughly;' marg., 'as with lye') is lit. 'as with _bor_.' This word means 'clearness,' and hence also that which makes clear, or pure, alkali.

No trace of it or of the other cities of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west coast of the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt called Jebel Usdum, 'the hill of Sodom.' It has been concluded, from this and from other considerations, that the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the Dead Sea.

Nathan, to whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., 'beloved of the Lord' (<r>2 Sam. 12:24, 25</r>). He was the first king of Israel 'born in the purple.' His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: 'Assuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me.' His history is recorded in 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chr. 1-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father's death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah (<r>1 Kings 1:5-40</r>). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the 'Augustan age' of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages (<r>1 Kings 11:1-8; 14:21, 31</r>)."},

They at once proceeded on their important errand, and went through the land as far north as the district round Lake Merom. After about six weeks' absence they returned. Their report was very discouraging, and the people were greatly alarmed, and in a rebellious spirit proposed to elect a new leader and return to Egypt. Only two of the spies, Caleb and Joshua, showed themselves on this occasion stout-hearted and faithful. All their appeals and remonstrances were in vain. Moses announced that as a punishment for their rebellion they must now wander in the wilderness till a new generation should arise which would go up and posses the land. The spies had been forty days absent on their expedition, and for each day the Israelites were to be wanderers for a year in the desert. (<see target='x-self'>See ESHCOL.</see>)"},

It is the root of an Indian plant, the Nardostachys jatamansi, of the family of Valeriance, growing on the Himalaya mountains. It is distinguished by its having many hairy spikes shooting out from one root. It is called by the Arabs sunbul Hindi, 'the Indian spike.' In the New Testament this word is the rendering of the Greek nardos pistike. The margin of the Revised Version in these passages has 'pistic nard,' pistic being perhaps a local name.

Sin-offerings were also presented at the five annual festivals (Num. 28, 29), and on the occasion of the consecration of the priests (<r>Ex. 29:10-14, 36</r>). As each individual, even the most private member of the congregation, as well as the congregation at large, and the high priest, was obliged, on being convicted by his conscience of any particular sin, to come with a sin-offering, we see thus impressively disclosed the need in which every sinner stands of the salvation of Christ, and the necessity of making application to it as often as the guilt of sin renews itself upon his conscience. This resort of faith to the perfect sacrifice of Christ is the one way that lies open for the sinner's attainment of pardon and restoration to peace. And then in the sacrifice itself there is the reality of that incomparable worth and preciousness which were so significantly represented in the sin-offering by the sacredness of its blood and the hallowed destination of its flesh. With reference to this the blood of Christ is called emphatically 'the precious blood,' and the blood that 'cleanseth from all sin' (<r>1 John 1:7</r>)."},
{i:3512,k:"Sinai",t:"of Sin (the moon god), called also Horeb, the name of the mountain district which was reached by the Hebrews in the third month after the Exodus. Here they remained encamped for about a whole year. Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment, including all the windings of the route, was about 150 miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Num. ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim (<r>Ex. 17:8-13</r>) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, 'the desert of Sinai,' about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there 'before the mountain.' The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, 'The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the 'mount that might be touched,' and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below.' This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the 'wilderness of Paran,' the 'et-Tih', i.e., 'the desert', and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.), Num. 11:1-3. The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year.

{i:3513,k:"Sinaiticus codex",t:"usually designated by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is one of the most valuable of ancient MSS. of the Greek New Testament. On the occasion of a third visit to the convent of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, in 1859, it was discovered by Dr. Tischendorf. He had on a previous visit in 1844 obtained forty-three parchment leaves of the LXX., which he deposited in the university library of Leipsic, under the title of the Codex Frederico-Augustanus, after his royal patron the king of Saxony. In the year referred to (1859) the emperor of Russia sent him to prosecute his search for MSS., which he was convinced were still to be found in the Sinai convent. The story of his finding the manuscript of the New Testament has all the interest of a romance. He reached the convent on 31st January; but his inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On the 4th February he had resolved to return home without having gained his object. 'On that day, when walking with the provisor of the convent, he spoke with much regret of his ill-success. Returning from their promenade, Tischendorf accompanied the monk to his room, and there had displayed to him what his companion called a copy of the LXX., which he, the ghostly brother, owned. The MS. was wrapped up in a piece of cloth, and on its being unrolled, to the surprise and delight of the critic the very document presented itself which he had given up all hope of seeing. His object had been to complete the fragmentary LXX. of 1844, which he had declared to be the most ancient of all Greek codices on vellum that are extant; but he found not only that, but a copy of the Greek New Testament attached, of the same age, and perfectly complete, not wanting a single page or paragraph.' This precious fragment, after some negotiations, he obtained possession of, and conveyed it to the Emperor Alexander, who fully appreciated its importance, and caused it to be published as nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the ancient handwriting. The entire codex consists of 346 1/2 folios. Of these 199 belong to the Old Testament and 147 1/2 to the New, along with two ancient documents called the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. The books of the New Testament stand thus: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul, the Acts of the Apostles, the Catholic Epistles, the Apocalypse of John. It is shown by Tischendorf that this codex was written in the fourth century, and is thus of about the same age as the Vatican codex; but while the latter wants the greater part of Matthew and sundry leaves here and there besides, the Sinaiticus is the only copy of the New Testament in uncial characters which is complete. Thus it is the oldest extant MS. copy of the New Testament. Both the Vatican and the Sinai codices were probably written in Egypt. (<see target='x-self'>See VATICANUS.</see>)"},

The building had suffered considerably from natural decay as well as from the assaults of hostile armies, and Herod, desirous of gaining the favour of the Jews, proposed to rebuild it. This offer was accepted, and the work was begun (B.C. 18), and carried out at great labour and expense, and on a scale of surpassing splendour. The main part of the building was completed in ten years, but the erection of the outer courts and the embellishment of the whole were carried on during the entire period of our Lord's life on earth (<r>John 2:16, 19-21</r>), and the temple was completed only A.D. 65. But it was not long permitted to exist. Within forty years after our Lord's crucifixion, his prediction of its overthrow was accomplished (<r>Luke 19: 41-44</r>). The Roman legions took the city of Jerusalem by storm, and notwithstanding the strenuous efforts Titus made to preserve the temple, his soldiers set fire to it in several places, and it was utterly destroyed (A.D. 70), and was never rebuilt."},

In the beginning of his reign Solomon set about giving effect to the desire that had been so earnestly cherished by his father, and prepared additional materials for the building. From subterranean quarries at Jerusalem he obtained huge blocks of stone for the foundations and walls of the temple. These stones were prepared for their places in the building under the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He also entered into a compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for the supply of whatever else was needed for the work, particularly timber from the forests of Lebanon, which was brought in great rafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it was dragged to Jerusalem (1 Kings 5). As the hill on which the temple was to be built did not afford sufficient level space, a huge wall of solid masonry of great height, in some places more than 200 feet high, was raised across the south of the hill, and a similar wall on the eastern side, and in the spaces between were erected many arches and pillars, thus raising up the general surface to the required level. Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply for the temple by hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into which water was conveyed by channels from the 'pools' near Bethlehem. One of these cisterns, the 'great sea,' was capable of containing three millions of gallons. The overflow was led off by a conduit to the Kidron."},
{i:3612,k:"Temple, the Second",t:"After the return from captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and the high priest Jeshua, arrangements were almost immediately made to reorganize the long-desolated kingdom. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, including children, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceeding by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first cares was to restore their ancient worship by rebuilding the temple. On the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics (probably about $6,000), besides other gifts, the people with great enthusiasm poured their gifts into the sacred treasury (Ezra 2). First they erected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (B.C. 535), amid great public excitement and rejoicing (Ps. 116; 117; 118), the foundations of the second temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mingled feelings by the spectators (<r>Hag. 2:3; Zech. 4:10</r>). The Samaritans made proposals for a co-operation in the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however, declined all such cooperation: Judah must build the temple without help. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. The Samaritans sought to 'frustrate their purpose' (<r>Ezra 4:5</r>), and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended. Seven years after this Cyrus died ingloriously, having killed himself in Syria when on his way back from Egypt to the east, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses (B.C. 529-522), on whose death the 'false Smerdis,' an imposter, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius Hystaspes became king (B.C. 522). In the second year of this monarch the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion (<r>Ezra 5: 6-17; 6:1-15</r>), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah.

It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued (<r>Judg. 1:31</r>). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel (<r>Judg. 10:12</r>). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its 'virgin daughter' (<r>Isa. 23:12</r>), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel (<r>1 Kings 11:1, 33</r>).

This was Samson's birthplace (<r>Judg. 13:2, 25</r>), and near it he found a grave (16:31). It was situated on the crest of a hill overlooking the valley of Sorek, and was fortified by Rehoboam (<r>2 Chr. 11:10</r>). It has been identified with Sur'ah, in the Wady Surar, 8 miles west of Jerusalem. It is noticed on monuments in the fifteenth century B.C. as attacked by the Abiri or Hebrews."},
{i:3648,k:"Temptation",t:"(1.) Trial; a being put to the test. Thus God 'tempted [Gen. 22: 1; R.V., 'did prove'] Abraham;' and afflictions are said to tempt, i.e., to try, men (<r>James 1:2, 12; comp. Deut. 8:2</r>), putting their faith and patience to the test. (2.) Ordinarily, however, the word means solicitation to that which is evil, and hence Satan is called 'the tempter' (<r>Matt. 4:3</r>). Our Lord was in this way tempted in the wilderness. That temptation was not internal, but by a real, active, subtle being. It was not self-sought. It was submitted to as an act of obedience on his part. 'Christ was led, driven. An unseen personal force bore him a certain violence is implied in the words' (<r>Matt. 4:1-11</r>)."},

He had three sons, Haran, Nahor, and Abraham, and one daughter, Sarah. He settled in 'Ur of the Chaldees,' where his son Haran died, leaving behind him his son Lot. Nahor settled at Haran, a place on the way to Ur. Terah afterwards migrated with Abraham (probably his youngest son) and Lot (his grandson), together with their families, from Ur, intending to go with them to Canaan; but he tarried at Haran, where he spent the remainder of his days, and died at the age of two hundred and five years (<r>Gen. 11:24-32; Josh. 24:2</r>). What a wonderful part the descendants of this Chaldean shepherd have played in the history of the world!"},
{i:3652,k:"Teraphim",t:"givers of prosperity, idols in human shape, large or small, analogous to the images of ancestors which were revered by the Romans. In order to deceive the guards sent by Saul to seize David, Michal his wife prepared one of the household teraphim, putting on it the goat's-hair cap worn by sleepers and invalids, and laid it in a bed, covering it with a mantle. She pointed it out to the soldiers, and alleged that David was confined to his bed by a sudden illness (<r>1 Sam. 19:13-16</r>). Thus she gained time for David's escape. It seems strange to read of teraphim, images of ancestors, preserved for superstitious purposes, being in the house of David. Probably they had been stealthily brought by Michal from her father's house. 'Perhaps,' says Bishop Wordsworth, 'Saul, forsaken by God and possessed by the evil spirit, had resorted to teraphim (as he afterwards resorted to witchcraft); and God overruled evil for good, and made his very teraphim (by the hand of his own daughter) to be an instrument for David's escape.', Deane's David, p. 32. Josiah attempted to suppress this form of idolatry (<r>2 Kings 23:24</r>). The ephod and teraphim are mentioned together in Hos. 3:4. It has been supposed by some (Cheyne's Hosea) that the 'ephod' here mentioned, and also in Judg. 8:24-27, was not the part of the sacerdotal dress so called (<r>Ex. 28:6-14</r>), but an image of Jehovah overlaid with gold or silver (comp. Judg. 17, 18; 1 Sam. 21:9; 23:6, 9; 30:7, 8), and is thus associated with the teraphim. (<see target='x-self'>See THUMMIM.</see>)"},

The charges he adduced against the apostle were, 'First, that he created disturbances among the Romans throughout the empire, an offence against the Roman government (crimen majestatis). Secondly, that he was a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes; disturbed the Jews in the exercise of their religion, guaranteed by the state; introduced new gods, a thing prohibited by the Romans. And thirdly, that he attempted to profane the temple, a crime which the Jews were permitted to punish.'"},

Abimelech led his army against this place, because of its participation in the conspiracy of the men of Shechem; but as he drew near to the strong tower to which its inhabitants had fled for safety, and was about to set fire to it, a woman cast a fragment of millstone at him, and 'all to brake his skull' i.e., 'altogether brake,' etc. His armourbearer thereupon 'thrust him through, and he died' (<r>Judg. 9:50-55</r>)."},

If the thief could not pay the fine, he was to be sold to a Hebrew master till he could pay (<r>Ex. 22:1-4</r>). A night-thief might be smitten till he died, and there would be no blood-guiltiness for him (22:2). A man-stealer was to be put to death (21:16). All theft is forbidden (<r>Ex. 20:15; 21:16; Lev. 19:11; Deut. 5:19; 24:7; Ps. 50:18; Zech. 5:3; Matt. 19:18; Rom. 13:9; Eph. 4:28; 1 Pet. 4:15</r>)."},
{i:3667,k:"Theocracy",t:"a word first used by Josephus to denote that the Jews were under the direct government of God himself. The nation was in all things subject to the will of their invisible King. All the people were the servants of Jehovah, who ruled over their public and private affairs, communicating to them his will through the medium of the prophets. They were the subjects of a heavenly, not of an earthly, king. They were Jehovah's own subjects, ruled directly by him (comp. 1 Sam. 8:6-9)."},

Nothing beyond this is known of him. From the fact that Luke applies to him the title 'most excellent', the same title Paul uses in addressing Felix (<r>Acts 23:26; 24:3</r>) and Festus (26:25), it has been concluded that Theophilus was a person of rank, perhaps a Roman officer."},

{i:3670,k:"Thessalonica",t:"a large and populous city on the Thermaic bay. It was the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia, and was ruled by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica, the wife of Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his second missionary journey, Paul preached in the synagogue here, the chief synagogue of the Jews in that part of Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church (<r>Acts 17:1-4; 1 Thes. 1:9</r>). The violence of the Jews drove him from the city, when he fled to Berea (<r>Acts 17:5-10</r>). The 'rulers of the city' before whom the Jews 'drew Jason,' with whom Paul and Silas lodged, are in the original called politarchai, an unusual word, which was found, however, inscribed on an arch in Thessalonica. This discovery confirms the accuracy of the historian. Paul visited the church here on a subsequent occasion (20:1-3). This city long retained its importance. It is the most important town of European Turkey, under the name of Saloniki, with a mixed population of about 85,000."},

It is also rendered 'thorn' in 2 Chr. 33:11; Prov. 26:9; Cant. 2:2; 'brambles' in Isa. 34:13.

All we know regarding him is recorded in the fourth Gospel (<r>John 11:15, 16; 14:4, 5; 20:24, 25, 26-29</r>). From the circumstance that in the lists of the apostles he is always mentioned along with Matthew, who was the son of Alphaeus (<r>Mark 3:18</r>), and that these two are always followed by James, who was also the son of Alphaeus, it has been supposed that these three, Matthew, Thomas, and James, were brothers."},

It denotes the seat of the high priest in 1 Sam. 1:9; 4:13, and of a provincial governor in Neh. 3:7 and Ps. 122:5. The throne of Solomon is described at length in 1 Kings 10:18-20."},

What the 'Urim and Thummim' were cannot be determined with any certainty. All we certainly know is that they were a certain divinely-given means by which God imparted, through the high priest, direction and counsel to Israel when these were needed. The method by which this was done can be only a matter of mere conjecture. They were apparently material objects, quite distinct from the breastplate, but something added to it after all the stones had been set in it, something in addition to the breastplate and its jewels. They may have been, as some suppose, two small images, like the teraphim (<r>comp. Judg. 17:5; 18:14, 17, 20; Hos. 3:4</r>), which were kept in the bag of the breastplate, by which, in some unknown way, the high priest could give forth his divinely imparted decision when consulted. They were probably lost at the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. They were never seen after the return from captivity."},

In Job 39:19, instead of 'thunder,' as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version translates (ra'amah) by 'quivering main' (marg., 'shaking'). Thunder accompanied the giving of the law at Sinai (<r>Ex. 19:16</r>). It was regarded as the voice of God (<r>Job 37:2; Ps. 18:13; 81:7; comp. John 12:29</r>). In answer to Samuel's prayer (<r>1 Sam. 12:17, 18</r>), God sent thunder, and 'all the people greatly feared,' for at such a season (the wheat-harvest) thunder and rain were almost unknown in Palestine."},
{i:3684,k:"Thyatira",t:"a city of Asia Minor, on the borders of Lydia and Mysia. Its modern name is Ak-hissar, i.e., 'white castle.' Here was one of the seven churches (<r>Rev. 1:11; 2:18-28</r>). Lydia, the seller of purple, or rather of cloth dyed with this colour, was from this city (<r>Acts 16:14</r>). It was and still is famous for its dyeing.

It was the Callitris quadrivalvis of botanists, of the cone-bearing order of trees, and of the cypress tribe of this order. The name of this wood is derived from the Greek word _thuein_, 'to sacrifice,' and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance. The wood of this tree was reckoned very valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans. Like the cedars of Lebanon, it is disappearing from the forests of Palestine."},

John (21:1) is the only evangelist who so designates this lake. His doing so incidentally confirms the opinion that he wrote after the other evangelists, and at a period subsequent to the taking of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). Tiberias had by this time become an important city, having been spared by the Romans, and made the capital of the province when Jerusalem was destroyed. It thus naturally gave its name to the lake."},

He is first mentioned in Scripture, however, as gaining a victory over Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin of Damascus, who were confederates. He put Rezin to death, and punished Pekah by taking a considerable portion of his kingdom, and carrying off (B.C. 734) a vast number of its inhabitants into captivity (<r>2 Kings 15:29; 16:5-9; 1 Chr. 5:6, 26</r>), the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh whom he settled in Gozan.

The apostle having formed a high opinion of his 'own son in the faith,' arranged that he should become his companion (<r>Acts 16:3</r>), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist (<r>1 Tim. 4:14</r>), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea (<r>Acts 17:14</r>). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica (17:15; 1 Thess. 3:2). We next find him at Corinth (<r>1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1</r>) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus (<r>Acts 19:22</r>), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia (20:4), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him (<r>Phil. 1:1</r>), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment (<r>Heb. 13:23</r>). During the apostle's second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments (<r>2 Tim. 4:13</r>). According to tradition, after the apostle's death he settled in Ephesus as his sphere of labour, and there found a martyr's grave."},
{i:3703,k:"Timothy, First Epistle to",t:"Paul in this epistle speaks of himself as having left Ephesus for Macedonia (1:3), and hence not Laodicea, as mentioned in the subscription; but probably Philippi, or some other city in that region, was the place where this epistle was written. During the interval between his first and second imprisonments he probably visited the scenes of his former labours in Greece and Asia, and then found his way into Macedonia, whence he wrote this letter to Timothy, whom he had left behind in Ephesus."},
{i:3704,k:"Timothy, Second Epistle to",t:"was probably written a year or so after the first, and from Rome, where Paul was for a second time a prisoner, and was sent to Timothy by the hands of Tychicus. In it he entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (<r>comp. Phil. 2:22</r>). He was anticipating that 'the time of his departure was at hand' (<r>2 Tim. 4:6</r>), and he exhorts his 'son Timothy' to all diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under persecution (1:6-15), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (4:1-5), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of quick and dead."},
{i:3705,k:"Tin",t:"Heb. bedil (<r>Num. 31:22; Ezek. 22:18, 20</r>), a metal well known in ancient times. It is the general opinion that the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon obtained their supplies of tin from the British Isles. In Ezek. 27:12 it is said to have been brought from Tarshish, which was probably a commercial emporium supplied with commodities from other places. In Isa. 1:25 the word so rendered is generally understood of lead, the alloy with which the silver had become mixed (ver. 22). The fire of the Babylonish Captivity would be the means of purging out the idolatrous alloy that had corrupted the people."},

All the land traffic between the east and the west passed through it. Menahem undertook an expedition against this city, and 'smote Tiphsah and all that were therein' (<r>2 Kings 15:16</r>). This expedition implied a march of some 300 miles from Tirzah if by way of Tadmor, and about 400 if by way of Aleppo; and its success showed the strength of the Israelite kingdom, for it was practically a defiance to Assyria. Conder, however, identifies this place with Khurbet Tafsah, some 6 miles west of Shechem."},

{i:3709,k:"Tires",t:"'To tire' the head is to adorn it (<r>2 Kings 9:30</r>). As a noun the word is derived from 'tiara,' and is the rendering of the Heb. p'er, a 'turban' or an ornament for the head (<r>Ezek. 24:17; R.V., 'headtire;' 24:23</r>). In Isa. 3:18 the word _saharonim_ is rendered 'round tires like the moon,' and in Judg. 8:21, 26 'ornaments,' but in both cases 'crescents' in the Revised Version."},
{i:3710,k:"Tirhakah",t:"the last king of Egypt of the Ethiopian (the fifteenth) dynasty. He was the brother-in-law of So (q.v.). He probably ascended the throne about B.C. 692, having been previously king of Ethiopia (<r>2 Kings 19:9; Isa. 37:9</r>), which with Egypt now formed one nation. He was a great warrior, and but little is known of him. The Assyrian armies under Esarhaddon, and again under Assur-bani-pal, invaded Egypt and defeated Tirhakah, who afterwards retired into Ethiopia, where he died, after reigning twenty-six years."},
{i:3711,k:"Tirshatha",t:"a word probably of Persian origin, meaning 'severity,' denoting a high civil dignity. The Persian governor of Judea is so called (<r>Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65, 70</r>). Nehemiah is called by this name in Neh. 8:9; 10:1, and the 'governor' (pehah) in 5:18. Probably, therefore, tirshatha=pehah=the modern pasha."},
{i:3712,k:"Tirza",t:"pleasantness. (1.) An old royal city of the Canaanites, which was destroyed by Joshua (<r>Josh. 12:24</r>). Jeroboam chose it for his residence, and he removed to it from Shechem, which at first he made the capital of his kingdom. It remained the chief residence of the kings of Israel till Omri took Samaria (<r>1 Kings 14:17; 15:21; 16:6, 8, etc.</r>). Here Zimri perished amid the flames of the palace to which in his despair he had set fire (<r>1 Kings 16:18</r>), and here Menahem smote Shallum (<r>2 Kings 15:14, 16</r>). Solomon refers to its beauty (<r>Cant. 6:4</r>). It has been identified with the modern mud hamlet Teiasir, 11 miles north of Shechem. Others, however, would identify it with Telluza, a village about 6 miles east of Samaria."},
{i:3713,k:"Tishbite",t:"Elijah the prophet was thus named (<r>1 Kings 17:1; 21:17, 28, etc.</r>). In 1 Kings 17:1 the word rendered 'inhabitants' is in the original the same as that rendered 'Tishbite,' hence that verse may be read as in the LXX., 'Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbi in Gilead.' Some interpret this word as meaning 'stranger,' and read the verse, 'Elijah the stranger from among the strangers in Gilead.' This designation is probably given to the prophet as denoting that his birthplace was Tishbi, a place in Upper Galilee (mentioned in the apocryphal book of Tobit), from which for some reason he migrated into Gilead. Josephus, the Jewish historian (<r>Ant. 8:13, 2</r>), however, supposes that Tishbi was some place in the land of Gilead. It has been identified by some with el-Ishtib, a some place 22 miles due south of the Sea of Galilee, among the mountains of Gilead."},

{i:3715,k:"Tithe",t:"a tenth of the produce of the earth consecrated and set apart for special purposes. The dedication of a tenth to God was recognized as a duty before the time of Moses. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek (<r>Gen. 14:20; Heb. 7:6</r>); and Jacob vowed unto the Lord and said, 'Of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.'"},

{i:3717,k:"Titus",t:"honourable, was with Paul and Barnabas at Antioch, and accompanied them to the council at Jerusalem (<r>Gal. 2:1-3; Acts 15:2</r>), although his name nowhere occurs in the Acts of the Apostles. He appears to have been a Gentile, and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles; for Paul sternly refused to have him circumcised, inasmuch as in his case the cause of gospel liberty was at stake. We find him, at a later period, with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was sent by Paul to Corinth for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor saints at Jerusalem sent forward (<r>2 Cor. 8:6; 12:18</r>). He rejoined the apostle when he was in Macedonia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth (7:6-15). After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul's first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church in Crete, where the apostle had left him for this purpose (<r>Titus 1:5</r>). The last notice of him is in 2 Tim. 4:10, where we find him with Paul at Rome during his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into Dalmatia, no doubt on some important missionary errand. We have no record of his death. He is not mentioned in the Acts."},
{i:3718,k:"Titus, Epistle to",t:"was probably written about the same time as the first epistle to Timothy, with which it has many affinities. 'Both letters were addressed to persons left by the writer to preside in their respective churches during his absence. Both letters are principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be sought for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the church; and the ingredients of this description are in both letters nearly the same. Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned against the same prevailing corruptions, and in particular against the same misdirection of their cares and studies. This affinity obtains not only in the subject of the letters, which from the similarity of situation in the persons to whom they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike, but extends in a great variety of instances to the phrases and expressions. The writer accosts his two friends with the same salutation, and passes on to the business of his letter by the same transition (comp. 1 Tim. 1:2, 3 with Titus 1:4, 5; 1 Tim.1:4 with Titus 1:13, 14; 3:9; 1 Tim. 4:12 with Titus 2:7, 15).', Paley's Horae Paulinae."},

'Eliashib the priest' prepared for him during Nehemiah's absence 'a chamber in the courts of the house of God,' which on his return grieved Nehemiah sore, and therefore he 'cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber' (13:7, 8)."},

They were sometimes made in gardens (<r>2 Kings 21:26; 23:16; Matt. 27:60</r>). They are found in great numbers in and around Jerusalem and all over the land. They were sometimes whitewashed (<r>Matt. 23:27, 29</r>). The body of Jesus was laid in Joseph's new rock-hewn tomb, in a garden near to Calvary. All evidence is in favour of the opinion that this tomb was somewhere near the Damascus gate, and outside the city, and cannot be identified with the so-called 'holy sepulchre.' The mouth of such rocky tombs was usually closed by a large stone (Heb. golal), which could only be removed by the united efforts of several men (<r>Matt. 28:2; comp. John 11:39</r>).

What this gift actually was has been a subject of much discussion. Some have argued that it was merely an outward sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit among the disciples, typifying his manifold gifts, and showing that salvation was to be extended to all nations. But the words of Luke (<r>Acts 2:9</r>) clearly show that the various peoples in Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost did really hear themselves addressed in their own special language with which they were naturally acquainted (<r>comp.

'Fire being the most destructive of all elements, is chosen by the sacred writers to symbolize the agency by which God punishes or destroys the wicked. We are not to assume from prophetical figures that material fire is the precise agent to be used. It was not the agency employed in the destruction of Sennacherib, mentioned in Isa. 30:33...Tophet properly begins where the Vale of Hinnom bends round to the east, having the cliffs of Zion on the north, and the Hill of Evil Counsel on the south. It terminates at Beer 'Ayub, where it joins the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The cliffs on the southern side especially abound in ancient tombs. Here the dead carcasses of beasts and every offal and abomination were cast, and left to be either devoured by that worm that never died or consumed by that fire that was never quenched.'

The concurrence between them in all the circumstances of the incident is exact. John seems to allude to it also (<r>John 1:14</r>). Forty years after the event Peter distinctly makes mention of it (<r>2 Pet. 1:16-18</r>).

Wisdom is compared to the tree of life (<r>Prov. 3:18</r>). The 'tree of life' spoken of in the Book of Revelation (<r>Rev. 2:7; 22:2, 14</r>) is an emblem of the joys of the celestial paradise."},

It was one of the seven days of holy convocation. The special design of this feast, which is described in these verses, is not known."},
{i:3763,k:"Truth",t:"Used in various senses in Scripture. In Prov. 12:17, 19, it denotes that which is opposed to falsehood. In Isa. 59:14, 15, Jer. 7:28, it means fidelity or truthfulness. The doctrine of Christ is called 'the truth of the gospel' (<r>Gal. 2:5</r>), 'the truth' (<r>2 Tim. 3:7; 4:4</r>). Our Lord says of himself, 'I am the way, and the truth' (<r>John 14:6</r>)."},

{i:3767,k:"Turtle, Turtle-dove",t:"Its peculiar peaceful and gentle habit its often referred to in Scripture. A pair was offered in sacrifice by Mary at her purification (<r>Luke 2:24</r>). The pigeon and the turtle-dove were the only birds permitted to be offered in sacrifice (<r>Lev. 1:14; 5:7; 14:22; 15:14, 29, etc.</r>). The Latin name of this bird, _turtur_, is derived from its note, and is a repetition of the Hebrew name _tor_. Three species are found in Palestine, (1) the turtle-dove (Turtur auritus), (2) the collared turtle (T. risorius), and (3) the palm turtle (T. Senegalensis). But it is to the first of these species which the various passages of Scripture refer. It is a migratory bird (<r>Jer. 8:7; Cant. 2:11, 12</r>). 'Search the glades and valleys, even by sultry Jordan, at the end of March, and not a turtle-dove is to be seen. Return in the second week of April, and clouds of doves are feeding on the clovers of the plain. They overspread the whole face of the land.' 'Immediately on its arrival it pours forth from every garden, grove, and wooded hill its melancholy yet soothing ditty unceasingly from early dawn till sunset. It is from its plaintive and continuous note, doubtless, that David, pouring forth his heart's sorrow to God, compares himself to a turtle-dove' (<r>Ps. 74:19</r>)."},

It properly means a 'model' or 'pattern' or 'mould' into which clay or wax was pressed, that it might take the figure or exact shape of the mould.

'Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)' (Driver's Isaiah).

A fragment of the arch (q.v.) of this bridge (called 'Robinson's Arch'), where it projects from the sanctuary wall, was discovered by Robinson in 1839.

It was in reality a two-horned animal; but the exact reference of the word so rendered (reem) is doubtful. Some have supposed it to be the buffalo; others, the white antelope, called by the Arabs rim. Most probably, however, the word denotes the Bos primigenius ('primitive ox'), which is now extinct all over the world. This was the auerochs of the Germans, and the urus described by Caesar (Gal. Bel., vi.28) as inhabiting the Hercynian forest. The word thus rendered has been found in an Assyrian inscription written over the wild ox or bison, which some also suppose to be the animal intended (<r>comp.

It stood near the mouth of the Euphrates, on its western bank, and is represented by the mounds (of bricks cemented by bitumen) of el-Mugheir, i.e., 'the bitumined,' or 'the town of bitumen,' now 150 miles from the sea and some 6 miles from the Euphrates, a little above the point where it receives the Shat el-Hie, an affluent from the Tigris. It was formerly a maritime city, as the waters of the Persian Gulf reached thus far inland. Ur was the port of Babylonia, whence trade was carried on with the dwellers on the gulf, and with the distant countries of India, Ethiopia, and Egypt.

When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah, in direct violation of the divine law (<r>Num. 4:15</r>), put forth his hand to steady the ark, and was immediately smitten unto death.

He was a vigorous and able ruler, and 'his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt' (<r>2 Chr. 26:8, 14</r>). In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and 'did that which was right in the sight of the Lord' (<r>2 Kings 15:3; 2 Chr. 26:4, 5</r>); but toward the close of his long life 'his heart was lifted up to his destruction,' and he wantonly invaded the priest's office (<r>2 Chr. 26:16</r>), and entering the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him (<r>2 Chr. 26:17</r>), saying, 'It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense.' Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of offering incense (26:19-21), and he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in 'a several house' to the day of his death (<r>2 Kings 15:5, 27; 2 Chr. 26:3</r>).

{i:3820,k:"Ward",t:"a prison (<r>Gen. 40:3, 4</r>); a watch-station (<r>Isa. 21:8</r>); a guard (<r>Neh. 13:30</r>)."},
{i:3821,k:"Wars of the Lord, The Book of the",t:"(<r>Num. 21:14, 15</r>), some unknown book so called (<r>comp. Gen. 14:14-16; Ex. 17:8-16; Num. 14:40-45; 21:1-3, 21-25, 33-35; 31. The wars here recorded might be thus designated</r>)."},
{i:3822,k:"Washing",t:"(<r>Mark 7:1-9</r>). The Jews, like other Orientals, used their fingers when taking food, and therefore washed their hands before doing so, for the sake of cleanliness. Here the reference is to the ablutions prescribed by tradition, according to which 'the disciples ought to have gone down to the side of the lake, washed their hands thoroughly, 'rubbing the fist of one hand in the hollow of the other, then placed the ten finger-tips together, holding the hands up, so that any surplus water might flow down to the elbow, and thence to the ground.'' To neglect to do this had come to be regarded as a great sin, a sin equal to the breach of any of the ten commandments. Moses had commanded washings oft, but always for some definite cause; but the Jews multiplied the legal observance till they formed a large body of precepts. To such precepts about ceremonial washing Mark here refers. (<see target='x-self'>See ABLUTION.</see>)"},
{i:3823,k:"Watches",t:"the periods into which the time between sunset and sunrise was divided. They are so called because watchmen relieved each other at each of these periods. There are frequent references in Scripture to the duties of watchmen who were appointed to give notice of the approach of an enemy (<r>2 Sam. 18:24-27; 2 Kings 9:17-20; Isa. 21:5-9</r>). They were sometimes placed for this purpose on watch-towers (<r>2 Kings 17:9; 18:8</r>). Ministers or teachers are also spoken of under this title (<r>Jer. 6:17; Ezek. 33:2-9; Heb. 13:17</r>)."},
{i:3824,k:"Watchings",t:"(<r>2 Cor. 6:5</r>), lit. 'sleeplessnesses,' the result of 'manual labour, teaching, travelling, meditating, praying, cares, and the like' (Meyer's Com.)."},
{i:3825,k:"Water of jealousy",t:"a phrase employed (not, however, in Scripture) to denote the water used in the solemn ordeal prescribed by the law of Moses (<r>Num. 5:11-31</r>) in cases of 'jealousy.'"},
{i:3826,k:"Water of purification",t:"used in cases of ceremonial cleansings at the consecration of the Levites (<r>Num. 8:7</r>). It signified, figuratively, that purifying of the heart which must characterize the servants of God."},
{i:3827,k:"Water of separation",t:"used along with the ashes of a red heifer for the ceremonial cleansing of persons defiled by contact with a dead body (Num. 19)."},
{i:3828,k:"Waterspouts",t:"(<r>Ps. 42:7; marg. R.V., 'cataracts'</r>). If we regard this psalm as descriptive of David's feelings when banished from Jerusalem by the revolt of Absalom, this word may denote 'waterfalls,' inasmuch as Mahanaim, where he abode, was near the Jabbok, and the region abounded with rapids and falls."},
{i:3829,k:"Wave offerings",t:"parts of peace-offerings were so called, because they were waved by the priests (<r>Ex. 29:24, 26, 27; Lev. 7:20-34; 8:27; 9:21; 10:14, 15, etc.</r>), in token of a solemn special presentation to God. They then became the property of the priests. The first-fruits, a sheaf of barley, offered at the feast of Pentecost (<r>Lev. 23:17-20</r>), and wheat-bread, the first-fruits of the second harvest, offered at the Passover (10-14), were wave-offerings."},

{i:3832,k:"Weasel",t:"(Heb. holedh), enumerated among unclean animals (<r>Lev. 11:29</r>). Some think that this Hebrew word rather denotes the mole (Spalax typhlus) common in Palestine. There is no sufficient reason, however, to depart from the usual translation. The weasel tribe are common also in Palestine."},
{i:3833,k:"Weaving, weavers",t:"Weaving was an art practised in very early times (<r>Ex. 35:35</r>). The Egyptians were specially skilled in it (<r>Isa. 19:9; Ezek. 27:7</r>), and some have regarded them as its inventors."},
{i:3834,k:"Week",t:"From the beginning, time was divided into weeks, each consisting of six days of working and one of rest (<r>Gen. 2:2, 3; 7:10; 8:10, 12; 29:28</r>). The references to this division of days becomes afterwards more frequent (<r>Ex. 34:22; Lev. 12:5; Num. 28:26; Deut. 16:16; 2 Chr. 8:13; Jer. 5:24; Dan. 9:24-27; 10:2, 3</r>). It has been found to exist among almost all nations."},

{i:3836,k:"Weights",t:"Reduced to English troy-weight, the Hebrew weights were: (1.) The gerah (<r>Lev. 27:25; Num. 3:47</r>), a Hebrew word, meaning a grain or kernel, and hence a small weight. It was the twentieth part of a shekel, and equal to 12 grains."},
{i:3837,k:"Well",t:"(Heb. beer), to be distinguished from a fountain (Heb. 'ain). A 'beer' was a deep shaft, bored far under the rocky surface by the art of man, which contained water which percolated through the strata in its sides. Such wells were those of Jacob and Beersheba, etc. (<r>see Gen. 21:19, 25, 30, 31; 24:11; 26:15, 18-25, 32, etc.</r>). In the Pentateuch this word beer, so rendered, occurs twenty-five times."},

{i:3839,k:"Whale",t:"The Hebrew word _tan_ (plural, tannin) is so rendered in Job 7:12 (A.V.; but R.V., 'sea-monster'). It is rendered by 'dragons' in Deut. 32:33; Ps. 91:13; Jer. 51:34; Ps. 74:13 (marg., 'whales;' and marg. of R.V., 'sea-monsters'); Isa. 27:1; and 'serpent' in Ex. 7:9 (R.V. marg., 'any large reptile,' and so in ver. 10, 12). The words of Job (7:12), uttered in bitter irony, where he asks, 'Am I a sea or a whale?' simply mean, 'Have I a wild, untamable nature, like the waves of the sea, which must be confined and held within bounds, that they cannot pass?' 'The serpent of the sea, which was but the wild, stormy sea itself, wound itself around the land, and threatened to swallow it up...Job inquires if he must be watched and plagued like this monster, lest he throw the world into disorder' (Davidson's Job)."},
{i:3840,k:"Wheat",t:"one of the earliest cultivated grains. It bore the Hebrew name _hittah_, and was extensively cultivated in Palestine. There are various species of wheat. That which Pharaoh saw in his dream was the Triticum compositum, which bears several ears upon one stalk (<r>Gen. 41:5</r>). The 'fat of the kidneys of wheat' (<r>Deut. 32:14</r>), and the 'finest of the wheat' (<r>Ps. 81:16; 147:14</r>), denote the best of the kind. It was exported from Palestine in great quantities (<r>1 Kings 5:11; Ezek. 27:17; Acts 12:20</r>)."},
{i:3841,k:"Wheel",t:"(Heb. galgal; rendered 'wheel' in Ps. 83:13, and 'a rolling thing' in Isa. 17:13; R.V. in both, 'whirling dust'). This word has been supposed to mean the wild artichoke, which assumes the form of a globe, and in autumn breaks away from its roots, and is rolled about by the wind in some places in great numbers."},
{i:3842,k:"White",t:"a symbol of purity (<r>2 Chr. 5:12; Ps. 51:7; Isa. 1:18; Rev. 3:18; 7:14</r>). Our Lord, at his transfiguration, appeared in raiment 'white as the light' (<r>Matt. 17:2, etc.</r>)."},

{i:3844,k:"Wife",t:"The ordinance of marriage was sanctioned in Paradise (<r>Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:4-6</r>). Monogamy was the original law under which man lived, but polygamy early commenced (<r>Gen. 4:19</r>), and continued to prevail all down through Jewish history. The law of Moses regulated but did not prohibit polygamy. A man might have a plurality of wives, but a wife could have only one husband. A wife's legal rights (<r>Ex. 21:10</r>) and her duties (<r>Prov. 31:10-31; 1 Tim. 5:14</r>) are specified. She could be divorced in special cases (<r>Deut. 22:13-21</r>), but could not divorce her husband. Divorce was restricted by our Lord to the single case of adultery (<r>Matt. 19:3-9</r>). The duties of husbands and wives in their relations to each other are distinctly set forth in the New Testament (<r>1 Cor. 7:2-5; Eph. 5:22-33; Col. 3:18, 19; 1 Pet. 3:1-7</r>)."},
{i:3845,k:"Wilderness",t:"(1.) Heb. midhbar, denoting not a barren desert but a district or region suitable for pasturing sheep and cattle (<r>Ps. 65:12; Isa. 42:11; Jer. 23:10; Joel 1:19; 2:22</r>); an uncultivated place. This word is used of the wilderness of Beersheba (<r>Gen. 21:14</r>), on the southern border of Palestine; the wilderness of the Red Sea (<r>Ex. 13:18</r>); of Shur (15:22), a portion of the Sinaitic peninsula; of Sin (17:1), Sinai (<r>Lev. 7:38</r>), Moab (<r>Deut. 2:8</r>), Judah (<r>Judg. 1:16</r>), Ziph, Maon, En-gedi (<r>1 Sam. 23:14, 24; 24:1</r>), Jeruel and Tekoa (<r>2 Chr. 20:16, 20</r>), Kadesh (<r>Ps. 29:8</r>)."},

This was supposed to be the weeping willow, called by Linnaeus Salix Babylonica, from the reference in Ps. 137. This tree is frequently found 'on the coast, overhanging wells and pools. There is a conspicuous tree of this species over a pond in the plain of Acre, and others on the Phoenician plain.' There are several species of the salix in Palestine, but it is not indigenous to Babylonia, nor was it cultivated there. Some are of opinion that the tree intended is the tamarisk or poplar."},
{i:3847,k:"Wimple",t:"Isa. 3:22, (R.V., 'shawls'), a wrap or veil. The same Hebrew word is rendered 'vail' (R.V., 'mantle') in Ruth 3:15."},
{i:3848,k:"Window",t:"properly only an opening in a house for the admission of light and air, covered with lattice-work, which might be opened or closed (<r>2 Kings 1:2; Acts 20:9</r>). The spies in Jericho and Paul at Damascus were let down from the windows of houses abutting on the town wall (<r>Josh. 2:15; 2 Cor. 11:33</r>). The clouds are metaphorically called the 'windows of heaven' (<r>Gen. 7:11; Mal. 3:10</r>). The word thus rendered in Isa. 54:12 ought rather to be rendered 'battlements' (LXX., 'bulwarks;' R.V., 'pinnacles'), or as Gesenius renders it, 'notched battlements, i.e., suns or rays of the sun'= having a radiated appearance like the sun."},
{i:3849,k:"Winds",t:"blowing from the four quarters of heaven (<r>Jer. 49:36; Ezek. 37:9; Dan. 8:8; Zech. 2:6</r>). The east wind was parching (<r>Ezek. 17:10; 19:12</r>), and is sometimes mentioned as simply denoting a strong wind (<r>Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8</r>). This wind prevails in Palestine from February to June, as the west wind (<r>Luke 12:54</r>) does from November to February. The south was a hot wind (<r>Job 37:17; Luke 12:55</r>). It swept over the Arabian peninsula. The rush of invaders is figuratively spoken of as a whirlwind (<r>Isa. 21:1</r>); a commotion among the nations of the world as a striving of the four winds (<r>Dan. 7:2</r>). The winds are subject to the divine power (<r>Ps. 18:10; 135:7</r>)."},
{i:3850,k:"Wine",t:"The common Hebrew word for wine is _yayin_, from a root meaning 'to boil up,' 'to be in a ferment.' Others derive it from a root meaning 'to tread out,' and hence the juice of the grape trodden out. The Greek word for wine is _oinos_, and the Latin _vinun_. But besides this common Hebrew word, there are several others which are thus rendered."},
{i:3851,k:"Wine-press",t:"Consisted of two vats or receptacles, (1) a trough (Heb. gath, Gr. lenos) into which the grapes were thrown and where they were trodden upon and bruised (<r>Isa. 16:10; Lam. 1:15; Joel 3:13</r>); and (2) a trough or vat (Heb. yekebh, Gr. hypolenion) into which the juice ran from the trough above, the gath (<r>Neh. 13:15; Job 24:11; Isa. 63:2, 3; Hag. 2:16; Joel 2:24</r>). Wine-presses are found in almost every part of Palestine. They are 'the only sure relics we have of the old days of Israel before the Captivity. Between Hebron and Beersheba they are found on all the hill slopes; they abound in southern Judea; they are no less common in the many valleys of Carmel; and they are numerous in Galilee.' The 'treading of the wine-press' is emblematic of divine judgment (<r>Isa. 63:2; Lam. 1:15; Rev. 14:19, 20</r>)."},
{i:3852,k:"Winefat",t:"(<r>Mark 12:1</r>). The original word (hypolenion) so rendered occurs only here in the New Testament. It properly denotes the trough or lake (lacus), as it was called by the Romans, into which the juice of the grapes ran from the trough above it. It is here used, however, of the whole apparatus. In the parallel passage in Matt. 21:33 the Greek word _lenos_ is used. This properly denotes the upper one of the two vats. (See WINE-PRESS"},
{i:3853,k:"Winnow",t:"Corn was winnowed, (1.) By being thrown up by a shovel against the wind. As a rule this was done in the evening or during the night, when the west wind from the sea was blowing, which was a moderate breeze and fitted for the purpose. The north wind was too strong, and the east wind came in gusts. (2.) By the use of a fan or van, by which the chaff was blown away (<r>Ruth 3:2; Isa. 30:24; Jer. 4:11, 12; Matt. 3:12</r>)."},
{i:3854,k:"Wise men",t:"mentioned in Dan. 2:12 included three classes, (1) astrologers, (2) Chaldeans, and (3) soothsayers. The word in the original (hakamim) probably means 'medicine men. In Chaldea medicine was only a branch of magic. The 'wise men' of Matt. 2:7, who came from the East to Jerusalem, were magi from Persia or Arabia."},
{i:3855,k:"Wise, wisdom",t:"a moral rather than an intellectual quality. To be 'foolish' is to be godless (<r>Ps. 14:1; comp. Judg. 19:23; 2 Sam. 13:13</r>). True wisdom is a gift from God to those who ask it (<r>Job 28:12-28; Prov. 3:13-18; Rom. 1:22; 16:27; 1 Cor. 1:17-21; 2:6-8; James 1:5</r>). 'Wisdom' in Prov. 1:20; 8:1; 9:1-5 may be regarded not as a mere personification of the attribute of wisdom, but as a divine person, 'Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God' (<r>1 Cor. 1:24</r>). In Matt. 11:19 it is the personified principle of wisdom that is meant."},

They were the first to execute the sentence on the condemned (<r>Deut. 13:9; 17:7; 1 Kings 21:13; Matt. 27:1; Acts 7:57, 58</r>). False witnesses were liable to punishment (<r>Deut. 19:16-21</r>).

{i:3860,k:"Wizard",t:"a pretender to supernatural knowledge and power, 'a knowing one,' as the original Hebrew word signifies. Such an one was forbidden on pain of death to practise his deceptions (<r>Lev. 19:31; 20:6, 27; 1 Sam. 28:3; Isa. 8:19; 19:3</r>)."},
{i:3861,k:"Wolf",t:"Heb. zeeb, frequently referred to in Scripture as an emblem of treachery and cruelty. Jacob's prophecy, 'Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf' (<r>Gen. 49:27</r>), represents the warlike character of that tribe (<see target='x-self'>see Judg. 19-21</see>). Isaiah represents the peace of Messiah's kingdom by the words, 'The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb' (<r>Isa. 11:6</r>). The habits of the wolf are described in Jer. 5:6; Hab. 1:8; Zeph. 3:3; Ezek. 22:27; Matt. 7:15; 10:16; Acts 20:29. Wolves are still sometimes found in Palestine, and are the dread of shepherds, as of old."},
{i:3862,k:"Woman",t:"was 'taken out of man' (<r>Gen. 2:23</r>), and therefore the man has the preeminence. 'The head of the woman is the man;' but yet honour is to be shown to the wife, 'as unto the weaker vessel' (<r>1 Cor. 11:3, 8, 9; 1 Pet. 3:7</r>). Several women are mentioned in Scripture as having been endowed with prophetic gifts, as Miriam (<r>Ex. 15:20</r>), Deborah (<r>Judg. 4:4, 5</r>), Huldah (<r>2 Kings 22:14</r>), Noadiah (<r>Neh. 6:14</r>), Anna (<r>Luke 2:36, 37</r>), and the daughters of Philip the evangelist (<r>Acts 21:8, 9</r>). Women are forbidden to teach publicly (<r>1 Cor. 14:34, 35; 1 Tim. 2:11, 12</r>). Among the Hebrews it devolved upon women to prepare the meals for the household (<r>Gen. 18:6; 2 Sam. 13:8</r>), to attend to the work of spinning (<r>Ex. 35:26; Prov. 31:19</r>), and making clothes (<r>1 Sam. 2:19; Prov. 31:21</r>), to bring water from the well (<r>Gen. 24:15; 1 Sam. 9:11</r>), and to care for the flocks (<r>Gen. 29:6; Ex. 2:16</r>)."},

{i:3864,k:"Wood-offering",t:"(<r>Neh. 10:34; 13:31</r>).

{i:3865,k:"Wool",t:"one of the first material used for making woven cloth (<r>Lev. 13:47, 48, 52, 59; 19:19</r>). The first-fruit of wool was to be offered to the priests (<r>Deut. 18:4</r>). The law prohibiting the wearing of a garment 'of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together' (<r>Deut. 22:11</r>) may, like some other laws of a similar character, have been intended to express symbolically the separateness and simplicity of God's covenant people. The wool of Damascus, famous for its whiteness, was of great repute in the Tyrian market (<r>Ezek. 27:18</r>)."},
{i:3866,k:"Word of God",t:"(<r>Heb. 4:12, etc.</r>). The Bible so called because the writers of its several books were God's organs in communicating his will to men. It is his 'word,' because he speaks to us in its sacred pages. Whatever the inspired writers here declare to be true and binding upon us, God declares to be true and binding. This word is infallible, because written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and therefore free from all error of fact or doctrine or precept. (<see target='x-self'>See INSPIRATION; BIBLE.</see>) All saving knowledge is obtained from the word of God. In the case of adults it is an indispensable means of salvation, and is efficacious thereunto by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit (<r>John 17:17; 2 Tim. 3:15, 16; 1 Pet. 1:23</r>)."},

His office is to make God known. 'No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him' (<r>John 1:18</r>). This title designates the divine nature of Christ. As the Word, he 'was in the beginning' and 'became flesh.' 'The Word was with God ' and 'was God,' and was the Creator of all things (<r>comp.

They say if men are not saved by works, then works are not necessary. If the most moral of men are saved in the same way as the very chief of sinners, then good works are of no moment.

It is a type of bitterness, affliction, remorse, punitive suffering. In Amos 6:12 this Hebrew word is rendered 'hemlock' (R.V., 'wormwood').

The origin of this art is unknown, but there is reason to conclude that in the age of Moses it was well known. The inspired books of Moses are the most ancient extant writings, although there are written monuments as old as about B.C. 2000. The words expressive of 'writing,' 'book,' and 'ink,' are common to all the branches or dialects of the Semitic language, and hence it has been concluded that this art must have been known to the earliest Semites before they separated into their various tribes, and nations, and families."},
{i:3876,k:"Yarn",t:"Found only in 1 Kings 10:28, 2 Chr. 1:16. The Heb. word mikveh, i.e., 'a stringing together,' so rendered, rather signifies a host, or company, or a string of horses. The Authorized Version has: 'And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price;' but the Revised Version correctly renders: 'And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.'"},
{i:3877,k:"Year",t:"Heb. shanah, meaning 'repetition' or 'revolution' (<r>Gen. 1:14; 5:3</r>). Among the ancient Egyptians the year consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, with five days added to make it a complete revolution of the earth round the sun. The Jews reckoned the year in two ways, (1) according to a sacred calendar, in which the year began about the time of the vernal equinox, with the month Abib; and (2) according to a civil calendar, in which the year began about the time of the autumnal equinox, with the month Nisan. The month Tisri is now the beginning of the Jewish year."},

{i:3880,k:"Yoke-fellow",t:"(<r>Phil. 4:3</r>), one of the apostle's fellow-labourers. Some have conjectured that Epaphroditus is meant. Wyckliffe renders the phrase 'the german felowe', i.e., 'thee, germane [=genuine] comrade.'"},

'The collection of customs at Jericho, which at this time produced and exported a considerable quantity of balsam, was undoubtedly an important post, and would account for Zacchaeus being a rich man.' Being short of stature, he hastened on before the multitude who were thronging about Christ as he passed through Jericho on his way to Jerusalem, and climbed up a sycamore tree that he might be able to see him. When our Lord reached the spot he looked up to the publican among the branches, and addressing him by name, told him to make haste and come down, as he intended that day to abide at his house. This led to the remarkable interview recorded by the evangelist, and to the striking parable of the ten pounds (<r>Luke 19:12-27</r>). At Er-riha (Jericho) there is a large, venerable looking square tower, which goes by the traditional name of the House of Zacchaeus."},

'He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his fathers had done' (<r>2 Kings 14:29; 15:8-12</r>). In him the dynasty of Jehu came to an end."},
{i:3896,k:"Zacharias",t:"(1.) A priest of the course of Abia, the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which the priests had been originally divided by David (<r>1 Chr. 23:1-19</r>). Only four of these courses or 'families' of the priests returned from the Exile (<r>Ezra 2:36-39</r>); but they were then re-distributed under the old designations. The priests served at the temple twice each year, and only for a week each time. Zacharias's time had come for this service. During this period his home would be one of the chambers set apart for the priests on the sides of the temple ground. The offering of incense was one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who should have this great honour, an honour which no priest could enjoy more than once during his lifetime."},

He is first mentioned as coming to take part with David at Hebron (<r>1 Chr. 12:27, 28</r>). He was probably on this account made ruler over the Aaronites (27:17). Zadok and Abiathar acted as high priests on several important occasions (<r>1 Chr. 15:11; 2 Sam. 15:24-29, 35, 36</r>); but when Adonijah endeavoured to secure the throne, Abiathar went with him, and therefore Solomon 'thrust him out from being high priest,' and Zadok, remaining faithful to David, became high priest alone (<r>1 Kings 2:27, 35; 1 Chr. 29:22</r>). In him the line of Phinehas resumed the dignity, and held it till the fall of Jerusalem. He was succeeded in his sacred office by his son Azariah (<r>1 Kings 4:2; comp. 1 Chr. 6:3-9</r>)."},

{i:3905,k:"Zaphnath-paaneah",t:"the name which Pharaoh gave to Joseph when he raised him to the rank of prime minister or grand vizier of the kingdom (<r>Gen. 41:45</r>). This is a pure Egyptian word, and has been variously explained. Some think it means 'creator,' or 'preserver of life.' Brugsch interprets it as 'governor of the district of the place of life', i.e., of Goshen, the chief city of which was Pithom, 'the place of life.' Others explain it as meaning 'a revealer of secrets,' or 'the man to whom secrets are revealed.'"},

The point of arrest was the 'city of Adam beside Zaretan,' probably near Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok, some 30 miles up the river from where the people were encamped. There the water 'stood and rose upon an heap.' Thus the whole space of 30 miles of the river-bed was dry, that the tribes might pass over (<r>Josh. 3:16, 17; comp. Ps. 104:3</r>)."},

Zebah and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the Jordan with a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at Karkor, probably in the Hauran, and routed by Gideon. The kings were taken alive and brought back across the Jordan; and confessing that they had personally taken part in the slaughter of Gideon's brothers, they were put to death (comp. 1 Sam. 12:11; Isa. 10:26; Ps. 83:11)."},

The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet 'he did evil in the sight of the Lord' (<r>2 Kings 24:19, 20; Jer. 52:2, 3</r>). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt.

The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah.

But that the possession of Zelophehad might not pass away in the year of jubilee from the tribe to which he belonged, it was ordained by Moses that his daughters should not marry any one out of their father's tribe; and this afterwards became a general law (Num. 36)."},
